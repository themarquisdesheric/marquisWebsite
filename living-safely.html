				<span class="first">This is my apology</span> to the denizens of the slums en masse:
			</p>
			<p>
				After all these years of despair, I am writing this to let people know the truth of what happened, and to let people know that I truly regret the role I played and the consequences of my actions. I’m not proud of what I did, but I feel closure is necessary. They say that repentance paves the road to salvation, and if so then at least I know that I’m on the right track.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a young man, I was kidnapped and forced to take part in a series of remarkably violent crimes, crimes that haunt me to this day and ravage my dreams. I came to know the names of my captors during the brief stints of sobriety in which my drug-addled brain attempted to recuperate. Jules was the quintessential alpha male; muscular and with a shaved head, he was the kind of irascible person that you always wanted to keep an eye on. His lower back and part of his left rib cage had been tattooed with strange runes that were static, but appeared to be moving as soon as I shifted my gaze from them. Sahme was the wild card, nicer to me than Jules was at first, but he had a violent streak about him that I couldn’t help but dislike. Skinny and fast, he was built to climb fences and run from the local militias that had been plaguing his existence in these slums for years. His lower back was tattooed as well, although it was just a snaking trail of dots with a crooked feather at the end – it looked vaguely familiar, although I couldn’t tell you from where.
			</p>
			<p>
				We met under bizarre circumstances that I can’t quite recall due to smoking something they always carried close at hand, a malignant substance they called ‘the white pipe’ – a potent, highly addictive mixture of dagga and Mandrax, a banned tranquilizer. The white pipe originated in Africa and was a devil’s drug that gave you an intense, aggressive high for a few hours and made you liable to commit acts of extreme violence while under its mischievous spell. It was cheap and base, and very unpredictable. When coming down off of the white pipe, it dropped you off somewhere in the suburbs of euphoria to recuperate and try not to think about the spontaneous acts of violence you had undoubtedly manifested. My exposure to it was forced, although I can tell you that smoking it got easier and easier every time.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was while I was under the influence of this powerful drug that I learned a few things about humans - the capacity for violence is not merely a human phenomenon; it has its innumerable roots set in the animal kingdom and deep within our psyche. Every once in a while, the weeds from these roots latch onto a neuron, firing what we call primal urges and impulses. It is this predetermined faculty of violence, matched with our superior intellect and cunning that makes the human such a dangerous creature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily, we do have an innate defense mechanism for dealing with such horrors; thereby allowing society, and subsequently civilization, to flourish. Criminal rage is a tide with ebbs and flows that can be prevented by the systematic utilization of postpartum psychological dams to steady the mind’s murderous waters into a more manageable stream – whereas white pipe is the sudden rush of water that slams into those same psychological dams, setting free wave after wave of unrestrained violence and aggression. It is this, paired with white pipe’s potential for addiction that makes it purely diabolical in nature and, by definition, anathema to society.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was while I was addicted to this awful substance that I lost sight of the life I used to have: living in the slums with my girlfriend and trying to forge a better living for the both of us, undoubtedly in vain. Mine was a pathetic existence, tumbling down the streets as a dirty vagabond, but it was off-kilter enough that I could actually enjoy it and call it my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the few occasions that I tried to break free from the clutches of the white pipe, fragments of dreams would come back to haunt me; piecemeal images of the happier life I used to have. They were the brief spurs of nostalgia that I could not act upon, no matter how hard I tried.

			</p>
			<p>
				I distinctly remember the day my nightmarish new life began. We had been driving down the snaking back alleys of downtown – Jules at the wheel, Sahme sitting shotgun, and me on the bench in the back. It was broad daylight out so I wasn’t expecting anything bad to happen – everyone in this sprawling city was accustomed to the usual terrors only occurring after dark; daytime was considered a sabbatical cease-fire of sorts where the inhabitants of this god-forsaken city were free to go about their day without fear of violence.
			</p>
			<p>
				This all changed when Jules stopped the car next to a grocer’s shack and approached a woman sitting in her car, a beat up old Toyota from decades past. Without warning us, or even saying a word, he approached her car and opened fire point-blank into the driver’s side window with a gun I didn’t even know he had, turning what used to be her head into a crimson mess of bone fragments and glass. I was horrified, pounding on the inside of Jules’ truck, beating on the windows and pushing Sahme in front of me to let me get out, to <em>please just let me out of the fucking car.</em> I wanted no part in this egregious blight; I didn’t know anything of the sort was even going to happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jules opened what now appeared to be the ex-woman’s door, and politely stepped aside as her slumped body fell out onto the ground, seemingly in slow motion. He calmly proceeded to take the purse sitting on the passenger seat, and do a quick once-over of the car to determine if there was anything worthwhile left to steal. Finding nothing, he turned his back to the wanton mess he had left and began walking at a brisk pace towards the truck, a sardonic grin pasted across his face.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, it was clear that Sahme wasn’t going to let me get out of the car, and so when he passed the white pipe to me to calm me down, I had no choice but to sit back and accept it with a resigned sigh. It turns out I was still their prisoner after all. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, their rivulets leaving clean trails on my grimy face. The scene I had just witnessed felt like it could have easily been from another universe – this was reality and people’s heads were simply not meant to turn into abhorrent messes like that. Jules got into the car and peeled out, the smell of burnt rubber coalescing with the bitter chemical odor of the white pipe made me sick to my stomach and I vomited out of the window – Sahme just looked back and laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
				That night, Jules and Sahme made it very clear to me that I was going to help them and that we were going to be working together as a crew. I was already an accomplice they said (they were absolutely right, of course) so what did I have to lose? The cold look in their eyes screamed <em>no is not an answer</em>, but it was the only one I could think of and I defiantly challenged them. It took hours, but eventually they beat me into submission and made me understand that my place was at their side. The white pipe was incredibly conducive to violence, and they were prepping me with it to use me as a tool to their advantage – to <em>our</em> advantage, now - to help them commit these horrible crimes and become the plague of the streets that I myself had once tried to eradicate. I was being primed to become my own worst enemy. Had I been a stronger man, I would have died before giving in, but alas, I was not, and am not, and these words are history now.
			</p>
			<p>
 				It was only a few weeks later that the realization dawned on me that this was going to become my new life – committing brazen robberies by day, and shrinking back into the shadows of the slums at night. After the first few robberies, we had begun to reverse the existing system of safety by day, danger at night. We became the callous outlaws who had made it dangerous <em>always</em>, we were the scum of the earth that had taken a collapsed society one step further into a dark abyss that it couldn’t ever hope to back out of, we were the fear behind every lonely pedestrian’s eyes, we became the collective terror that roamed the streets. And <em>fed</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We worked hard as a team, and we watched each other’s backs – within a few months we had become professionals and the range of our attacks extended as far as our whims, driving haphazardly to places we’d never been to before to terrorize a new suburb, to expose a new town to our savage ways.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">

			</p>
			<p>
				Everything had been going swimmingly for close to a year now, and we had quite a stash at our disposal. We jokingly likened ourselves to modern-day pirates guiding our weathered truck through concrete seas, weaving our way across cracked black asphalt to ubiquitous enemies we chose seemingly at random. In the beginning we didn’t discriminate when we robbed; a victim was a victim and we did what was necessary to stay afloat as our loot piled up higher and higher in the truck bed, but as of late we had set our sights on more fruitful victims: the few remaining upper-class leftover from the fall of modern civilization. They were easy to spot; they had a swagger about them that they couldn’t hope to hide in a million years, but the swine seldom left their barricaded homes for fear of, well, people like us.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had taken to pawning the goods immediately after a heist, driving a few cities away before word got out that there had been another attack. We almost had enough cash to drive into the sunset and make a name for ourselves in some other town, just drive for days or even weeks until we reached one that we felt comfortable in and eventually settle down and never openly speak about how we got there. It was the proverbial mortar that bonded our trio’s figurative bricks, the common dream we all shared and aspired to achieve.
			</p>
			<p>
 				Our strategies grew more and more complex, leaving small margins for error. We each did our part, strapped to the teeth, and wreaked havoc upon our quarry with pitiless assaults and stoic faces that made us appear almost godlike in our victim’s eyes - we were violence personified. We were the divine angels that granted mercy in its purest form: <em>death</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paranoia grew with the months, and dissent crept in with its own agenda. The drives to virgin cities went from being raucous and merry to quiet, brooding trips rife with arguments over the potential local militias that might await us. Had we grown too bold? We had been pulling the same basic maneuver for almost a year now, and we were terrified that our once-captive audience was finally catching onto our game. Cities held no formal communications with one another, and so they weren’t theoretically alerted to our ruse beforehand, but rumors spread like fire, and that was a threat to our very existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unbeknownst to us at the time, we were in an irreparable state of <em>folie à trois</em> – the three of us caught in a vicious cycle of influencing each other’s already-paranoid delusions about the cattle turning the tables on us, the day they waited to ambush us in <em>the perfect trap</em> - and thereby we impressed our own psychotic worst fears upon the group as a whole, each of us adding our own little twist to the ‘last day’ scenario in which we would be looking down the proverbial gun barrel ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consequently, we perpetuated our fallacy of imminent doom as opposed to the converse reality that we actually lived in – there was a definite risk of an armed rebuttal, but the chance of it occurring was no greater than the one we had originally started off with. There was always the possibility for such an ambush, but with the scope of our attacks it just wasn’t feasible that an ambush would ever be waiting for us. We had gotten our cake, and we intended to eat it, too.

			<p>
 				I remember the last time I saw Jules and Sahme. We had been in one of the only nice cities I’d ever laid eyes on, the kind of place I’d want to grow old and die in. There was something almost ethereal about the way the light fell onto the plants and trees that surrounded the buildings, how certain cobblestones seemed to light up and shine in a strange dance as we made our way up the road towards a store on a hilltop. The sublime melodies of songbirds filled the air, and I deeply regretted the fact that we would be breaking the serenity of such a beautiful place.
			</p>
			<p>
				We got out of the truck around the corner from the storefront; Jules was methodically checking his gun, and Sahme was tying his shoelaces. I admired the view from our elevated position; there was a field with neat rows of fruit trees planted as far as the eye could see, and they stood majestically in the afternoon sun. It was the first and last time I had ever seen an orchard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahme called me over, breaking my spell. I switched the safety off of my gun and took a deep breath: it was time. Normally one of us would stay in the car as a getaway driver, but we all agreed that that wouldn’t be necessary here - the orchard was on the outskirts of the city, and no one was around for miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The door at the storefront was open, and we sauntered through it with the casual air of professionals, the guns in our hands the only hint to our malevolent intentions. There was a boy sitting on a chair near the door, and he stared at us with wide eyes as we walked by.
			</p>
			<p>
				The shopkeeper looked up, a beautiful young woman of about nineteen or twenty, and dropped the pen she had been writing with out of sheer surprise. She reminded me of the girlfriend I had left behind, and I was almost immediately overcome with emotion. I raised my hand in the hopes of aborting the operation, but Sahme slapped it down with one hand and pulled the trigger with his other.
			</p>
			<p>
 				To her defense, the poor girl didn’t even make a sound; she just stared at the red stain that began at the front of her apron and raced down to her knees, a crimson mess that complimented her rosy cheeks. Exhaling loudly, she slumped to the ground and lay still.
			</p>
			<p>
				The echo of the gunshot rang out across the fields and galvanized us to attention. With barely a moment’s hesitation, the three of us began scouring the store for valuables and the safe – we would find a way to break it open later. Somehow I managed to suppress my anger, constantly reminding myself that I would let Sahme have a piece of my mind as soon as we had gotten safely away from this once-perfect city. Our treasure trove secured, we left.
			</p>
			<p>
				With one final glance back at the store, we ran to the truck and piled into our usual positions – Jules driving and Sahme sitting shotgun, me on the bench in the back. Jules was laughing as he started the car, a sadistic laugh that turned into wet choking noises as the staccato of bullets came in through the rear window and passed through his head, leaving a glistening red curtain across the inside of the windshield.
			</p>
			<p>
				I turned back just in time to see the boy from the store drop the gun we didn’t expect him to have; and for some reason I thought back to the first robbery, when Jules had killed that poor woman with a gun that I didn’t know he had, either.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahme had already thrown the passenger door open and jumped out of the car, running berserk towards the boy on the hill with his gun blazing. Without thinking, I threw myself out of the car and shot Sahme in the back, three gratifying pulls of the trigger that made him scream as he dropped to his knees and lay prostrated in the grass.
			</p>
			<p>
 				I looked at the boy, and for a moment our eyes met - an ineffable exchange passing through those once-innocent eyes to my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				My heart was beating a tattoo in my chest as I turned around and walked to the other side of the car, pulling Jules’ limp body out of the driver’s seat and letting it fall into a heap on the ground. I accidentally stepped onto his face as I pulled myself into the driver’s seat, and it collapsed with a sickening yet strangely satisfying <em>crunch</em>. I turned back onto the cobblestone road and headed back in the direction of the only home I knew, the slums I came from.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">

			</p>
			<p>
				Many years have passed since I last saw that boy on the hill, and time has taken its toll on me. Breaking my addiction to the white pipe had made me regress into an animal state, easily panicked and frightened by my own shadow for months until the withdrawals finally ceased and I felt human again – human enough to be wracked with guilt and wake up screaming in the night, clutching sweat-soaked sheets and praying to a god that didn’t listen. Jules and Sahme still make cameo appearances in my dreams, but I’ve learned to shut them out, to resist their evil influences and attempt to get on with my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				I finally found my girlfriend again, the girl I was destined to marry, but she left me – calling me a brute, an animal, a proponent of sadism. I tried to convince her that my will was manipulated, that I was being used as a tool but she never did believe me. I’ve lived alone ever since, destined to waste away in solitude in honor of my victims, and it irks me to know that after all these years, there’s only one thing I’m really sure of: hell isn’t a place you go to after you die, hell is the life you live after you’ve squandered your own.
