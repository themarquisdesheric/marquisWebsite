			<h2>((the man with the gold pocket-watch))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">About twenty years</span> ago, I had been sitting on my usual bench in the Piazza de Asters with the day’s newspaper unfolded across my lap. It wasn’t that the news wasn’t interesting or filled with the usual calamities, but I just couldn’t get into it that day. My focus was elsewhere; my gaze kept wandering away from the headlines, distracted, looking for somewhere to run. A glint from across the Piazza caught my eye and I craned my neck to get a better look at it. On the other side of the Piazza de Asters, across a sea of gently rolling green hills and a row of weeping willows, sat a solitary figure on a weathered old bench much like my own. With one hand he was trying to keep the newspaper on his lap from being blown away in a sudden gust of wind – funny that there should be such harsh winds, I thought, for I felt no wind on my side of the Piazza – and with the other hand he was consulting something, perhaps a timepiece of sorts, but I couldn’t quite make it out. I narrowed my eyes and studied him over the top of my newspaper. A strange expression was painted on his face, and his jaw was set in a stubborn, determined way. In his hand he clutched a gold pocket-watch, and he studied it passionately, muttering something incomprehensible the whole time. He seemed to be entirely oblivious of the world around him, and his eyes had the lost, forlorn look of one condemned.
			</p>
			<p>
				The more I studied him, the more he seemed out of place. It was a clear day with only the slightest hints of a breeze, the kind of day you could spend peacefully sprawled out on the grasses of the Piazza, basking in the sun. Meanwhile, the man on the bench seemed to be having trouble with a rogue gust of wind: the newspaper was all but being torn out of his hands by a strong current. I looked around at the various trees and grasses of the Piazza: they swayed gently, undulating in the soft breeze, betraying no sign of the winds that plagued the man on the other bench. I looked away, trying to focus on my newspaper, but to no avail. My mind was elsewhere, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the man with the gold pocket-watch. I risked another glance at him: there he was, his brow furrowed in concentration behind the newspaper that proudly stood erect in his hands, and there was no sign of the winds that had so clearly tormented him only moments earlier. I watched the man, fascinated. There was something about him, something that kept tugging at me, begging my audience in an unfamiliar court. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				A short while later, the man shifted uncomfortably in his seat and I turned to look at him. A wind was picking up, ripping and tearing at the newspaper in his hands like a snarling dog, as if it was playing a game of tug-of-war with him. Without hesitating he reached into his coat-pocket: a curious, almost scared expression on his face as his hand scrambled about his pocket and retrieved the gold pocket-watch. In one smooth motion he pulled it out of his coat-pocket and clicked the small latch on the side. It popped open and I felt my heart drop in my chest. For a split second, the harsh winds on the other side of the Piazza stopped completely - as if the wind had paused to hiccup for a moment - and everything around the pocket-watch became momentarily distorted. It was as if the whole scene had been reduced to a beautiful reflection on the placid surface of a pond, and the pocket-watch signified the spot in which an indiscriminate pebble had broken the surface tension of the still water, sending ripples of haze coursing out across the otherwise serene Piazza; ripples that coursed out in one, two, three iterations and then faded into oblivion - or rather perfect clarity - leaving behind no trace to prove that they ever existed, nothing but the sharply defined, unwavering reality of the mundane present.
			</p>
			<p>
				My eyes were wide open, betraying my surprise. At that moment I knew with a certainty beyond words that a power far greater than my own was calling to me, had thrown up a flag for my eyes to see and my eyes alone. I knew I would have to acquire that gold pocket-watch, either by skulduggery or in good faith; I knew that every cell and fiber of my being craved it, needed it, wouldn’t sleep until I held it in my hands and tenderly gazed upon its face like a mother would her darling infant. I abruptly stood up and walked away, rolling up my newspaper. As I left the Piazza I felt myself being consumed by an irrationality far greater than the absurdity of my own erstwhile existence, and all for a foreign object I had scarcely seen. Why drop everything, why let my life grind to a halt simply because of a gold pocket-watch? It made no sense yet I was convinced in my delusions. I decided to try to stop thinking about it and go about my day.
			</p>
			<p>
				A whole week I spent trying to distract myself, every waking moment I spent trying to put the man and his timepiece out of my mind, but to no avail. I went on long, solitary walks in the forest; I spontaneously visited distant family of mine that I hadn’t seen in years and endured an excruciating dinner full of long silences and scrutinizing glares; I wrote crazed poetry that came to me seemingly out of nowhere, as if a subconscious mania pushed them to the surface of my being, rejecting them. The gods pushed and pulled at me, begging admission to the court of my mind, but I relented, trying to occupy myself with trivialities so I could shake the gold pocket-watch out of my head. Life seemed tedious and dull, and entirely lacking in the divine grandeur of the gold pocket-watch. In my dreams it would fly to me on beautiful white wings, the kind angels would have, with strong, snow-white feathers. A heavenly music seemed to emanate from it, the music of nepenthe, and in that sound the sorrows of the world fell apart and got lost.
			</p>
			<p>
				A full week after I had first seen him, I had been walking down the main thoroughfare when there he was again: the man with the gold pocket-watch! I stopped and stared with the air of one witnessing a mystical vision, and the throngs of the crowd flowed around my immobile body like the water of a creek rushing around a stubborn rock in its path. There he was, his head down and back bent, with one hand gingerly placed on his hat, as if bracing himself against a strong headwind. His eyes never wavered from a fixed point in the distance, and as he walked he seemed utterly oblivious to the world around him.
			</p>
			<p>
				This time I knew for certain that I would follow him, that every shred of my being needed that pocket-watch in my possession, and somewhere below the surface of my skin, a new void opened up. I knew I would not rest until I filled that empty space with the pocket-watch, I knew sleep would not come easily and my mind would not be my own again until I sated its desires. I set off after the man, stalking my prey and never letting him out of my sight. When he was in the market-place looking at a cantaloupe, turning it over and inspecting it from all angles, I was in the adjacent stall looking at braided necklaces, one eye on the necklaces and one eye on my quarry; when he was at the tailor’s getting measured for a suit, I was lingering about outside, deeply engrossed in an animated conversation with a constable. I followed him with the diligence of a shadow and the quiet of the grave, and I was certain that he did not know of my existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				At dusk he returned home to a nondescript apartment building in a bad part of town, which surprised me. Was he not worried about brigands and thieves? Was it not in bad sense to flaunt such an ornate gold pocket-watch in public? I decided to put the matter of right and wrong out of my mind, and let the man deal with the experience that comes with making mistakes. He would kick himself for years, that was for sure, he would regret the day he ever consulted that pocket-watch in a public full of watching eyes. At my own actions I felt no guilt, I felt no shame: I was but karma’s vessel, a third party paying off the debts that the man had accrued throughout his life; living, breathing proof that everything comes full circle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the next few days, I abandoned all I had known, my whole day-to-day existence, in order to follow the man like a jealous shadow and find out his routines, the rhythm of his life. In doing so, I experienced a strange by-product of the whole sordid affair: I began to know the man intimately, to see the little things that when added together comprised his life as a whole. I observed that he wouldn’t drink his coffee without having something sweet to accompany it, and that he was fond of Russian literature; I saw his comings and goings at the cafes and bars he frequented and took note of how often he relieved himself; and I waited, patiently biding my time. One night I almost bumped into him on the way to the washroom in a crowded cafe, but he didn’t so much as give me a second glance. I resolved to be more careful, and promised myself that if he should ever see my face, he should see it in the act of the theft I had been working so hard to ensure. There is nothing worse than a faceless enemy, nothing more satisfying than knowing the face of the one you despise. The old crones of Guinea know how to stitch this dark wisdom into their voodoo dolls, of this I am sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few weeks later I returned to his dingy apartment building in the dead of night, hoping to sneak into his room while he was asleep and relieve him of his treasure. I climbed up the creaky wooden staircase on tiptoes, making sure to step closest to the corner where the floor meets the wall so as to minimize the sound of my footsteps, like a rat in the dark, or a burglar – which is exactly what I was at the moment. How strange, I thought to myself, that one day I could be an ordinary god-fearing man, and the next I could be a burglar creeping along an unfamiliar building in the dead of night, with the dark motivation of riches clouding my mind. As I approached his door, I silenced my thoughts and listened intently for a few minutes before trying the doorknob. It opened, and I poured into the darkness of his room like a snake slowly uncoiling itself and moving towards its prey. There he was, laying on the bed fully clothed – how strange, I thought, for one to go to sleep fully clothed – and then, just as I was observing his sleeping form before me, he jumped up, as if from a bad dream.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You!” he shouted, pointing his trembling finger at me. “I knew it! Why do you keep following me? I saw you at the Piazza reading a newspaper, and a week later at the market, where you startled me to the point that I left my groceries there; I saw you at the Cafe de Montparnasse and the Little Prince; I see you in the morning, at night, everywhere! What do you want from me? Why do you torment me so?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stood there in front of him, dressed all in black and looking remarkably out of place in his dilapidated room, which was really no more than a glorified broom closet, and hardly large enough for the both of us to be standing there, anyway. There he was, trembling in anger in front of me, his face an irritated red flush of a mask and the veins on his forehead openly throbbing; and here I was, standing in front of him like some petty brigand. I hesitated for a moment, uncertain of how to proceed, and then decided to do what petty brigands do best: I shouted right back at him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s not you I want, you fool! It’s your pocket-watch! You wave it around in front of my nose like a prize just out of reach and you expect me to sit back like a callous fool and just let it slip out of my fingers? Never!”
			</p>
			<p>
				At this retort the man’s attitude changed completely. “You want the pocket-watch?” He said, dumbfounded, and began cackling like a madman; like a hyena, deranged. He pulled a chair out, the only piece of furniture in his spartan room aside from the bed and a small wooden desk, and extended it to me. Things were taking an abrupt turn to left-field, and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I sat down, feeling oddly out of place in the tiny room.
			</p>
			<p>
				 “I have been waiting for this day,” he told me. “Years and years I’ve waited for this moment to come, and it’s haunted me from the moment I first acquired this pocket-watch - acquired it much like you will, in blood, in the dead of night. Do you know what the man who I stole this watch from told me just before I killed him? He told me of an ancient Mayan greeting that is so powerful in its duality that it also exists as a law of the universe: <em>in lak'ech ala k'in.</em> And do you know what that means? It means <em>I am another yourself</em>. It means that I am you and you are me, and this cycle goes on forever. And you know what? I recognize myself in you, the me from twenty years ago who stole this same gold pocket-watch, the me who in doing so sold my soul to the devil.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He removed the pocket-watch from his coat-pocket and held it in the air in front of me, where it swung back and forth: left and right and then left again, like a divine pendulum. I swear on all that is holy that it left shimmering traces in the air around it, shockwaves, ripples - a divine energy was contained in that gold-pocket watch, of this I am certain, and this energy took hold of me, gripping me in its clutches like a vise. I couldn’t contain myself. I sprang out of the chair and seized the man’s throat in my hands, desperately trying to crush the life out of him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Take it!” He said, laughing. “Take it and choke on it,” he murmured, as his windpipe collapsed and the sounds of his laughter were reduced to a sickening wet gurgle. He went limp and I let go of him, letting his heavy body drop to the floor like so much useless weight. My breath came in ragged, panting bursts as I stood over him with the gold pocket-watch in my hand, openly admiring it. It was like a Faberge egg, a technological marvel of perfect craftsmanship. I pressed the latch on the side and the pocket-watch sprung open with a smooth, lubricated <em>swish</em>. It was beautifully manicured and diligently reported the time. I felt the hum and whirr of numerous gears moving in perfect unison beneath the handcrafted case, and took note of the strange runes that were subtly etched into the gold. Without looking into a mirror, I could feel it reflected in my eyes, burning in my pupils with the intensity of its own light. I closed the pocket-watch and slipped it into my coat-pocket, where it nestled perfectly, as if tailor-made for it. I smiled and stepped over the dead man’s body, making sure to leave the apartment building quietly and unseen through a rear exit.
			</p>
			<p>
				 My life since that fateful night has been anything but ordinary. The pocket-watch turned out to have a stranger property to it than simply being the object of my desire, and against all odds it gained an even stronger hold on my life than the way it had initially used me, rendering me wholly expedient and useful only in bringing itself into my possession. Otherworldly winds would spontaneously manifest themselves around me, always at times of divine providence: it was as if the pocket-watch was alerting me to hiccups in fate, moments of <em>deja vu</em>, hints of paradoxical importance. Everywhere I went, conditions seemed to favor the watch, and in a very curious manner indeed: instead of it simply reporting time, it seemed to change the events and circumstances around it to match its own internal logic; instead of simply keeping track of the passage of time and dutifully reporting it, the gold pocket-watch appeared to be the crux on which events unfolded and situations blossomed. I no longer took note of other human beings. I spent my days as if in a trance, speaking with others only by virtue of necessity, as if they were mere automatons, ghosts of the human shells they once occupied. I was no longer able to register emotion in the face of another. Children could be screaming next to me and I wouldn’t notice. It was as if the gold pocket-watch rendered me invisible to the world - oblivious to the world - because I carried the world with me wherever I went. It was as if it wasn’t simply a timepiece, but rather the fountain of existence that time streams out of, the very center of the universe that generates the cosmos and the never-ending fabric of space and time. It was the catalyst to the initial event spoken of in chaos theory. It was, and will always be, the center of the universe.

				But why am I telling you this depressing story that has provided naught but bad fortune for me? As I sit here, reading the day’s newspaper on my familiar bench in the Piazza de Asters, a sudden gust of wind tears at the newspaper in my hand and I have to clutch at it with both hands to keep it from flying away. As I flatten the wrinkles out of the paper on my lap, I see a man sitting on an adjacent bench across the square. He has a newspaper spread out in front of his face, shielding it from view, but he doesn’t seem to be very engrossed in it. Twice already I’ve caught him making furtive glances in my direction, each instance exactly as I consulted the pocket-watch for the time. Who is this man, with his determined expression and shifty eyes? He looks just like a man I saw a few days ago making his way near the old bus station with his collar propped up against the wind, the brim of his hat sitting low over his eyes, that same determined expression painted across his face. I feel my concentration ebbing away from the newspaper and my mind whirring into overdrive. That couldn’t have been the same man that I had bumped into last night as I was leaving The Parisian, could it? I glance around the Piazza, suddenly feeling like prey being stalked - a very unsettling feeling. As if realizing my distress, the man across the square abruptly stands up and begins walking away, slowly rolling up his newspaper. I watch his form as it retreats, and realize, with a sinking feeling that reeks of fear, that this is the same man who is going to kill me. I harbor no ill will towards this man, no more than I do against myself. All I know is that when I meet him face-to-face - and the time will inevitably come - I will approach him with a simple greeting: <em>in lak'ech ala k'in.</em>
