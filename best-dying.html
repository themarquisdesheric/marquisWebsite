			<h2>((the best part of dying))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">“Hey,”</span> the bum said, to no one in particular. “You’ve got to keep your chin up! Roll with the punches. Then, when they’re not looking… you strike!” He got up and shadowboxed for a few seconds, demonstrating surprising agility for a man of his age. A young boy walked up behind him and tugged on his dirty shirt, startling the boxing vagabond.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are you doing?”
			</p>
			<p>
				The question was as benign as it was open-ended, and tinged with the unique blend of naivety and innocence that only a child could pose. The bum spun on his heels, fists up, to face the boy. He studied him cautiously for a moment, then let his hands drop to his sides. He sat down next to his stack of newspapers and stared blankly at the street once more.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m watching the patterns,” he said, pausing momentarily in anticipation of an interruption. Finding none, he continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“People are generally nothing more than automatons, pawns who get in your way.” He grinned, exposing strangely white teeth. They seemed out of place on the older man’s dusty face.
			</p>
			<p>
				“They’re ruled by desires and fears, by the constraints of society, by the limitations of their intellect. They make the same mistakes their parents made, over and over, and then they resign themselves to thinking <em>this is how it is</em>. This is life, and getting older and more habit-dependent is the natural order of things.” He scoffed.
			</p>
			<p>
				“They’ll tell you over and over <em>son, you’re a dreamer</em> but don’t ever get your head out of the clouds. Don’t let them anchor you down to this world, to this mess that they’ve left for your generation to clean up. Hopefully. As if their generation tended to the mess left by the previous one.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy listened intently. <em>This man is speaking to me like he would another adult,</em> he thought. It was refreshing to be treated as an equal. He sat down in the grass next to the old man and retrieved a stick of gum from his pocket, tearing it in half and offering one of the pieces to his new friend. The older man accepted it graciously.
			</p>
			<p>
				“So I come here, day after day, and I watch the patterns. I see the same people walk by, slaves to the same daily desires, creatures of habit until the bitter end. I see the same mother drop her kids off at school and then run to Starbucks to get the same sugary latte, day after day, and whittle away what’s left of her life by playing Farmville on her overpriced iPhone. She’s never had a more successful virtual enterprise in her life, and she couldn’t be happier. With the exception of that nagging little afterthought in the back of her mind, the one that keeps whispering <em>but why didn’t you just start a real business?</em> She’s set, happy and content.” The bum turned to look at the boy.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s the same reason you shouldn’t play Guitar Hero, by the way, and just pick up a real guitar instead.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy listened, mesmerized. <em>This old man is interesting,</em> he thought, <em>much more interesting than mom or dad or any of those other people who are always too busy to pay me any attention.</em> He scooted closer to the bum.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What’s your name?” He asked, holding his breath and barely containing his excitement.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You do have a name, don’t you?”
			</p>
			<p>
				The old man sighed, suddenly tired.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“They called me Robert, before I dropped out of society. Robert Goddard. A name I was given by two people who loved me enough to name me and then leave me in an orphanage, abandoned. The product of a midsummer night’s dream.” He laughed, a dark, pitiful noise that seemed to hang in the air. He hugged his knees to his chest, rocking back and forth with his shoulders hunched, eyes fixated on an uneven patch of cement in one of the sidewalk squares. His white teeth were hidden behind an implacable frown.
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy furrowed his brow. He didn’t quite understand. He had a nagging afterthought that it would make sense to him one day, in the most terribly cruel way, and it would hurt him, years from now, in ways he wasn’t yet able to fathom. He decided to put it aside for now.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“So what do they call you now?” The boy was a bit peeved, although he wasn’t quite sure why. The sun didn’t seem as warm and comforting as it had been a moment earlier, and it seemed as if an invisible tension had fallen over him, as if he was being forced to grow up a bit faster than he ordinarily should have. He began to daydream about the abstract concept of <em>influence</em>, without actually having known the word. There was something otherworldly about this old man, he thought, something different and pure, a power in his words.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I guess my name is still Robert,” he mused, “but no one has called me that in years and years.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				A leaf that had been rustling in the breeze detached itself from a nearby tree and began its melancholy descent towards the ground. Autumn was almost over, and the days were getting shorter and colder. They watched in silence as the leaf got caught in a thermal and rose melodramatically, higher and higher, until it gently see-sawed its way to the ground. The old man’s eyes brimmed with tears, and for a long time neither of them spoke, each one lost in his own psychedelic thoughts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy thought about growing up, of the elaborate mystery of life and age and of the countless levels of experience one gains with each passing day. <em>I was so young this morning,</em> he thought. <em>I still have so much left to learn.</em> His head throbbed at the prospect of living to be his mother’s age. How would he remember it all? Where would it fit? He felt like he was suffocating, like the weight of the world was on his shoulders and was slowly pushing all of the air out of his lungs. <em>Anxiety</em>. Another concept he didn’t understand but he would have to get accustomed to.
			</p>
			<p>
 				The image of the leaf drifting to the ground played on repeat across the old man’s tired eyes. <em>Nothing lasts,</em> he thought. <em>Everything just gets older and replaced and forgotten.</em> He thought about his life, of the years of cold hard experience and the subsequent years spent analyzing them; of the euphoria and unbridled passions of youth, that effervescent pipe dream, that splendid, stupid naivety. He thought about his forthcoming death and its inevitability; of that beautiful, silent reverie. The thought was dark and alluring like a temptress reeling him in, and he didn’t resist, succumbing to her charms and wondering <em>what would it be like to feel nothing?</em>
			</p>

 				The old man was surprised to find himself in a beautiful garden surrounded by apple trees. The humid air was thick with pollen and the roses were blooming, giving off a sweet, almost intoxicating aroma. He was sitting cross-legged on a venetian rug with a dizzyingly intricate pattern and sitting across from him was by far the oldest woman he had ever seen. He could barely see her eyes beneath her hooded cloak, and the face that peered out at him was ancient, creased and ravaged by the merciless hands of time. Her lips were dirty and chapped, and she had an odor to her, like the musky smell of potatoes that have been left in a rucksack for too long. It reminded him of something, of a fertile woods-goddess or the mother he never met, of home, wherever it was, always so very, very far away.
			</p>
			<p>
				He looked around, bewildered. The old woman studied him apathetically, and he squirmed like a child in the dentist’s chair for the very first time: nervous and scared but knowing, deep down inside, that somehow he was going to leave in far better shape than he had come. It felt like she was delving into his mind, opening old cabinets here and peeking under the corners of carpets there, shuffling through stacks of paper and half-read books, leaving nothing behind in her wake. He came to the conclusion that he didn’t mind. It was a confession of sorts, and the easiest kind since he didn’t even have to confess to anything, just the crime of having lived a long time and having made many a mistake along the way. He felt relieved, and for reasons he couldn’t explain he trusted the woman more than he had ever trusted anyone. It felt good, that trust, to open up to someone after being alone for so long.
			</p>
			<p>
 				Maybe one spoke or the other imagined it, playing off it and countering the imagined statement of the other, parlance-style, parrying and lounging, deftly interpreting and analyzing imagined allegations. Again and again they took turns talking, or imagining it, and after a veritable lifetime adrift on the sea of their collective thoughts they felt that they had understood each other perfectly. Such was the gift of life and the malleability of thought, and the beautiful sophistication of those mysterious invisible lines that wend to and fro, connecting us to one another. For there was intrigue in the lives of others, and a dark, voyeuristic allure in that which is not ours. The old man closed his eyes, content. <em>So this is what dying feels like,</em> he thought. <em>I like it.</em>
			</p>	
			<p>
				***
			</p>
			<p>
 				He opened his eyes and found the boy staring at him, jaw-dropped and a look of utter disbelief on his face. “Robert! Robert!” he shouted, his high-pitched little voice brimming over with fanciful excitement. “You should have seen it! The woman, the mother, the patterns you were talking about and her iPhone! She dropped it. I saw the whole thing while you were spacing out, or thinking, or whatever it was you were doing.”
			</p>	
			<p>
				He was positively ecstatic and barely maintaining composure. The old man just nodded and listened with a dull, detached look in his eyes, still entranced from his foray into death. “She dropped it right as she was walking out of Starbucks and the screen cracked. You should have seen it! She screamed and threw her latte at the wall, and everyone acted like they didn’t see it.” He thought for a minute, his little face scrunched up, deep in thought. The bum looked across the street in the direction of the Starbucks. There was a telltale brown splotch on the wall. <em>That’s going to stain,</em> he thought. He still had his familiar cynicism but it had lost its edge. “I still don’t get it though,” the boy said. “How come everyone acted like they didn’t see it? I know they saw it. I saw them see it.” He was frustrated and in dire need of consolation, but the old man didn’t quite know how to explain it to him. He sighed again, and for once, language failed him. He extended an arm. The boy scooted closer and leaned his head against the old man’s chest. Life was strange and getting stranger every day, but he was glad. He had learned a lot today, and made a new friend. He was ready for the adventure of life and the promise of tomorrow. He couldn’t wait to grow up. <em>Today was a good day,</em> he thought.
