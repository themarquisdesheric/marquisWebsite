			<h2>((the trouble with dreams))</h2>
			<p>
				To my dearly departed lover:
			</p>
			<p>
				How I wish you were here to tell me again about the dream that changed you so.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ll never forget how you woke me up that next morning and before you had even said a word I could immediately tell that something in your nature had changed, some undeniable truth in the core of your being had shifted, metamorphosed - so powerfully and completely that it was as undeniable as it was irreversible.
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn’t quite realize it then, but I know it now – with that heart-wrenching, utter certainty that goes hand-in-hand with hard truths – that you woke up as a different person. Your eyes had the look of one who had tasted the ambrosia of the gods, had conferred with the serpent and eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge – and lived to tell the tale. It wasn’t you, my dear, who woke me up that morning – it was someone else entirely, a prophet from the land of dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				You spoke with a passion so unbridled and reverent that I dared not question the validity of your claims, dared not ask how much it hurt to end up back here, <em>home</em> (that velvet-lined prison cell), deposed from the kingdom of Heaven and thrown back into this rat’s maze of cruel reality. Oh, how much it must have worn you out to have tasted bliss and been thrown back here in seeming exile, how frustrating it must have been.
			</p>
			<p>
				You told me that you found yourself in a world similar to ours, but at the same time so very different: about a heavenly city where people went to sleep without worries and woke up without the need of alarms; of humans that weren’t scared of what they were or who they would become because they were already entirely themselves: beautiful, and infinite, too; an unwavering force like the one that moves the sun and moon in their fixed orbits, creatures of divine habit. You said they burned brilliantly, each one radiating a thousand beams of light, and to stare at them was to know God (but only because you could recognize yourself in their being, for we are all gods, every last one of us).
			</p>
			<p>
				The way you described first finding yourself there – was that nothing short of Revelation? - how you woke up in Xanadu and everything was as it should be: soft white sheets, a benevolent sun warmly shining down upon you, and music of the most divine order playing on instruments that had yet to be invented (or so you swore). You said that upon waking you realized two things at once - disparate, contradictory things, but undeniable truths nonetheless – that you had never been so sure that you had finally found home; and that you had the unmistakeable feeling of finding yourself in a dream, but knowing, deep down inside, that it was more than just a dream: it was the one true Reality all the mystics spoke of, the eternal godhead.
			</p>
			<p>
				And perhaps what resonates most strongly in my mind was how you described the people of that city: they looked the same as the people who inhabit our world, you said, but dressed in a different garb – a sort of flowing, soft robes that brought to mind the Phoenicians of ancient days, or perhaps the Greeks - but all in earth tones, no blacks or blues or reds or whites, but rather forest greens like the trees that line the streets of Adrogue, or the burnt umber of Native American pottery and the rich ochre color long used to symbolize holiness in the East. And the faces – oh, how you regaled me with stories of their faces! - you said that the people of the city had the most angelic expressions, what human faces were meant to look like: faces unblemished by the cruel contours of hate and malevolence, faces that were a testament to the purity of the soul. You likened your attempts at describing that subtle manifestation of inner peace to the thousands of philosophers who have tried to explain the Buddha’s smile over the years – it was something you had to see for yourself to believe, you said; it was something you had to experience. And even before that fateful dream you told me of whole books you had read about the Buddha’s appearance that described how anyone who came into contact with him could immediately tell that he was enlightened, from his passive smile to the gentle way he held his hand at his side so you knew without a doubt that he was pure. You said that you had found a world populated by saints, and the beautiful smile painted across your face told me that you didn’t lie.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you never told me much more than that – you told me about how much you felt at home, how you knew without a shadow of a doubt that your stay there was limited, and how you cried because unlike other dreams you knew this one to be True – and you completely immersed yourself in it; whether knowingly or unknowingly, it makes no difference. But you never told me how it ended – simply that you realized that our world (or should I say my world, since you are no longer a part of it) was just one big freeze-frame of suspended animation, one big iridescent raindrop tethered to a clouded sky; a world run by demons at the expense of the good: one big, perpetual mistake.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s been three years now since you’ve killed yourself, and I can’t stop wondering if it was to reach that same divine dream-scape you had visited that night in March. Perhaps it’s selfish of me to ask, and perhaps it’s wrong of me to suppose, but I never thought to ask you if there was a place for me in your perfect world, and I never before thought it to be an appropriate query. But my heart has grown sick with longing, and I’ve grown to understand that a house without the sound of your laughter can never be a home, and I can’t help but wonder if I’ll meet you up there in your city in the sky.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it pains me to say this, but those three years have been the hardest of my life. I spent every day convincing myself that you reached your promised land, that you smiled just as radiantly as when you first found yourself there, and that all the pieces fell into place perfectly and without a hitch while I suffered in the hell of your past.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe this is my curse, but I’ll never forget how you said that you kept waiting for the clouds to part and for that ominous raindrop to finally fall from the sky and drop to earth; how you kept waiting for the sun you knew was there to peek out from behind those ugly gray clouds and brighten your world again. But it never came, and I’ll never hold you responsible for not being able to persevere; I’ll never blame you for your actions. And maybe the worst part about all this is that I thought I had finally found you that morning, but it had never occurred to me until now that that was precisely the moment that I lost you forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wish you all the best, my love, nothing but the best.
