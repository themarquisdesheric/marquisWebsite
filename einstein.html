			<h2>((the man who looked like einstein))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">It was a dark and stormy night</span> on the picturesque Moroccan shore of Tangiers, where the only thing separating the cold waters of the Atlantic from the warm, idyllic waters of the Mediterranean was Cape Spartel; and there, just past the Cape, lay the famed Straight of Gibraltar, like a giant transatlantic turnstile. It was a night where the waves rose back, yawning as tall as apartment buildings and swallowing all the sound in their dark, gaping maws before crashing down with the force and intensity of tribal war drums. Bolts of lightning tore across the sky, illuminating the landscape below in all its distress: trees leaning, almost kissing the ground from the high winds; barricaded windows and closed shutters were visible across all the buildings and homes, like so many anthills trying to wait out the storm. Peals of thunder reverberated across the rocky shoreline, calamitous and entirely inconsequential to the story at hand, since this story takes place not on a coastal city in the grips of a thunderstorm, but rather in the apathetic streets of Los Angeles: drab and gray and drenched in the characteristically warm glow of a typically Southern California day, where the air is thick like the humid climate of a tropical island in the Caribbean, but entirely lacking in all the glorious amenities of such an island paradise.. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I had been walking down the street, coughing and trying not to breathe as I walked through the acrid black cloud of smoke left behind by a passing bus, when something caught my eye. It was a man across the street and a bit of a ways down, bent over next to a bus bench, hastily tying his shoes. The wall of the furniture store behind him looked more like a fresco of contemporary graffiti art rather than the simple wall advertisement it actually was, and as I watched, he stood up and retrieved an old, beat-up leather briefcase from the bus bench and set off at a brisk pace down the street. I recognized him immediately and watched, spellbound, as he receded into the distance. <em>That man looks just like Einstein,</em> I thought to myself. That bushy, silver-gray hair jumped out at me from a hundred textbook pictures, tugged at my memory from prize-winning speeches and lectures; that signature, resolute hint of a smile at the corners of his wrinkled face; that effortless air of self-confidence that only the truly genius possess and exude.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>There goes the greatest physicist of our time,</em> I thought to myself. The coattails of his gray tweed blazer trailed behind him as he broke into a run while trying to board a passing bus, getting smaller and smaller until he was no more than a tiny point in the horizon, a lone dot slapping his briefcase on the side of the bus in frustration. I couldn’t help but think of parallax and its ramifications; I couldn’t help but think that all I wanted to do was chase him, to beg him for a bit of sage wisdom or to sit and practice metaphysics with one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century, but alas, he was gone, as elusive as the Higgs-Boson; and even though I now knew he was out there, I was going to have to spend my whole life trying to find him.
			</p>
			<p>
				For weeks I couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t get that optimistic old German immigrant out of my thoughts. I would walk around aimlessly for days trying to put myself in the path of chance, tempting fate or destiny or whatever powers that be to grant me just one more meeting with my muse, my Einstein. They say that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was proving to the world that he exists, but I know of a better trick, a trick so genius that everyone still believes in it unfailingly and without question, a truth so logical in hindsight that it was a wonder we all missed it. And it made perfect sense to me, as crazy as it sounds, and I followed this newfound truth tirelessly, hoping to forge a friendship with the man we all unflaggingly considered to be long dead: Einstein. I wanted to approach him with a knowing smile and whisper into his ear <em>It’s OK, Albert. Your secret is safe with me,</em> give him a firm handshake and invite him over to my apartment for some tea and eclairs, and a long, dialectical chat. But to my distress, a month passed and I had not run into him again.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began to think that perhaps the city was getting to me, this dirty city with its crime and pollution, its inhabitants who pass by the same faces every day on their walk to work but still decline to say hello. I was about to board the bus one day, deep in my thoughts, when I caught sight of a familiar figure approaching me in the distance. I watched wide-eyed as the man neared me, the swagger in his walk a testament to his genius, and I immediately strode over to meet him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Hello there,” I said nonchalantly, “beautiful day, isn’t it?”
			</p>
			<p>
				His pace slowed down just a bit, and he studied me with cautiously narrowed eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It is,” he replied in a completely normal, typically West-coast American accent, an accent that was more the lack of an accent than an accent in itself. <em>He’s good,</em> I thought to myself. Not only had he removed all the traces of his native accent from his speech, but even the petulant expression on his face seemed to suggest that he wasn’t the great German physicist I knew him to be. I continued, undeterred.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” I said, putting my arm around his shoulders like an old friend and giving him a slight nudge to begin walking down the street. “Your secret is safe with me.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stopped walking for a moment and peered around cautiously before turning back to whisper in his ear. “I’m a fan,” I said, giving him a conspiratorial wink and a reassuring smile.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of his eyebrows rose sharply and I couldn’t help but be impressed. <em>He’s really done his homework,</em> I thought. But of course he did – the man was not only a genius, he was <em>the</em> genius!
			</p>
			<p>
				He peered out of those small eye sockets at me, his face a mask of incredulity and perhaps a hint of dissimulated annoyance.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Are you on drugs?” He asked, looking me straight in the eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“No,” I replied, beaming. “But if I was, I’d <em>really</em> want to talk to you.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He didn’t seem to understand the compliment in my words, and immediately took a step back.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Look,” he said, putting both hands before him like a mime tracing the outline of his invisible cage, “I don’t know how to say this, but I’m not who you think I am. I feel absolutely silly saying this, but.. I’m not Einstein, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“What’s your name?” I asked, demonstrating that I was willing to play along. “What do you go by now?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I go by my actual name,” he said, grumpily. “And my name isn’t Albert Einstein.” He glanced at his watch.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen, sir, I have to go,” he said, exhaling impatiently. “This has already gone on for too long.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He turned to leave and I put a tentative hand on his shoulder.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Before you go,” I said, “please, just a bit of wisdom? Just a little something I could think about for the next few weeks, maybe what you were thinking about when you woke up this morning, or some keen observation about the world that’s been on your mind lately?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don’t think you understand,” he said, exasperated. “If you must know, I’m simply an actor who <em>plays</em> Albert Einstein in B-list movies and under-financed documentaries about his life. I’m not <em>actually</em> Einstein. Do you get it?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded slowly, a big, shit-eating grin on my face.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s genius,” I said, nodding and beaming. “I’m amazed I didn’t think of that before – you’ve convinced the world that you died, but also found a way to stop aging – so no one thinks you’re Einstein because Einstein is, of course, dead. But he’s not. You’re him. And it’s even more genius to think that you were able to peer so far into the future; that you were so prescient as to know that your celebrity is one that would be celebrated for decades – centuries, even – and knew that with the advent of film you would have a career doing the seemingly impossible – playing yourself in movies and interviews for the rest of your indefinite life, making sure your legacy is protected; for we all know that biography is the greatest fear of celebrities, and rightfully so – brutes, those biographers, careless brutes! And the most amazing thing to me is not that you’re the only one to do this, but that you do it right under our noses, and operate with absolute impunity. You’ve truly earned your reputation.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He narrowed those dark eyes at me, those wise, knowing eyes that peered out at me from posters and textbooks my whole life, those eyes that inspired and changed the face of the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				“A beautiful theory, but I’m afraid it’s entirely specious.” He said, throwing his arms up in frustration.
			</p>
			<p>	
				“And listen, I really must be going. The only reason I look like this right now is because I’m going to yet another audition. The life of a genius, you know, struggling and not even owning a car, running from one audition to the next and struggling, always struggling, to make ends meet. Relying on the poorly organized cesspool that is public transportation in Los Angeles. Truly genius. Anyway, I’m going to be late. Good-bye.”
			</p>
			<p>
				And just like that, he was off. Now that I knew the area in which I assumed he lived, I was going to frequent it more often in the hopes of running into him again. I’m not so easily fooled as to take what he said on good faith. I had done my homework and was going to meet my idol, for how many chances do you get to meet someone you worship and respect and had previously thought to be dead?
			</p>
			<p>
				Two weeks later I was at a sidewalk cafe surreptitiously reading a newspaper when I saw him approaching. I immediately set the newspaper down and rose to meet him just as he was about to walk past me.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Hello there,” he said, greeting me cautiously. He knew the ball was in my court.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Say,” I said, wasting no time and getting to the heart of the matter. “Have you ever thought about extraterrestrial life? Do you think something is out there, waiting to be discovered?”
			</p>
			<p>
				His eyebrows angled down sharply in the middle, pointing toward his nose like the two arms at the bottom of a pinball machine. He began muttering something but hesitated and, thinking better of it, turned to look me full-on in the eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How about this?” He said, taking a deep breath. “Our scientists take remote-operated submersibles down into the deepest recesses of the ocean and bring life up from the depths. Life that has never before encountered light from our sun. Life that has never known of any existence other than the depths – and the depths, just so you know, are almost no different from deep space – it’s a very similar kind of environment. So say one of these human scientists dredges up a new species of octopus from the dark abyss below the waves, a creature that we all know to be extremely intelligent and entirely conscious of its surroundings. So we bring it up to the surface, and it feels less and less pressure on it as it makes its way up, kind of like what we humans would experience if you took one of us further away from the Earth, outside of the scope of gravity: a lack of weight, freedom of movement and less resistance from our surroundings, albeit infinitely more pressure in our situation. So we bring this poor creature up so we can observe it: perhaps we put it into a specially-made aquarium if it survives the journey to the surface, or we dissect it if it happens to have died on the way up. Its anger, fears, comfort or frustration are not necessarily taken into account. And what does this creature know about life outside of water; what does this poor, intelligent octopus understand about a world <em>above</em> water, or of the humans that so painstakingly and deliberately brought it to the surface?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Einstein paused for a moment, looking at me as if waiting for me to meet him in the middle. My silence beckoned him to continue.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Absolutely nothing. In a very similar way, it makes perfect sense that a form of intelligent life is out there, a form of life that evolved parallel to our own but in an entirely different arena, unbeknownst to ourselves. So where am I going with all this? It is not stupid to consider such alternate forms of life, but rather it is <em>foolish</em> to attempt to consider such possibilities when we so clearly have a dearth of information. It is akin to conspiracy theorists fear-mongering about the Illuminati when they are on the absolutely bottom rung of the pecking order of the powers that be. It is an exercise in futility, no more and no less.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He stood up straighter for a moment, and folded his arms across his slightly-puffed out chest. His eyes were at half-mast; the familiar countenance of the philosopher-saint I so greatly admired. An errant tear worked its way down my cheek, and brought my muse back to reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s what I think, anyway.” He added quietly, realizing that he had played directly into my suspicions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I stared at him in awe, scrutinizing the wrinkles in his noble face like an old crone reading tea leaves, satisfied with the way they settled. I extended my trembling hand and he shook it, looking me directly in the eye with a studious, curious expression.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Thank you,” I said, and for the first time, I turned and walked away.
			</p>
			<p>
 				The walk back home to my apartment was a half-remembered blur, my mind abuzz with a new perspective, a new way of looking at things. That noble genius trusted me enough to bestow some real information on me, capital-T truth that I never could have hoped for in a million years. <em>What a world,</em> I thought to myself, <em>where a long-dead genius removes the cloak of his assumed identity and takes me beneath the wing of his gray tweed blazer; all to help me understand the universe a bit more clearly.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A month passed, and then another as I tirelessly contemplated the universe from my new perspective. It was like Einstein had given me rocket fuel, the perfect metaphysical fodder to aid me in my quest to understand the world I lived in, and it was a productive few months as the papers grew in taller and taller stacks on my desk, growing not unlike clusters of mushrooms, leaning at the top and sagging this way and that.
			</p>
			<p>
				One morning I awoke after a night of intense dreams where I felt like I had been abducted and put into a very small, sterile white room. It had a single window on one of the walls, a circular thing made of slightly convex glass that gave it the impression of a porthole. I stayed in that room for what seemed like an eternity, hurling myself at the walls like a lunatic in an insane asylum, for hours on end. At one point I lay prostrated on the cold floor, and for some reason I felt like I was being watched. I turned around slowly and looked over my shoulder toward the window, only to find my gaze met by a big, strange eye. I don’t quite know how to describe it aside that it reminded me of one of those googly-eyes that you can pick up from an arts and crafts store, the kind of eye that children paste onto construction paper. Two things were immediately apparent: one, that it was not a human eye; and two, that there was a definite intelligence in that eye, a cold, calculating intelligence that didn’t quite give a damn about my feelings or fears or frustrations. I woke up screaming, tangled and sweating in my covers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I went down to Einstein’s neighborhood that day, hoping to run into him, hoping he could deliver me from the visions he had instilled in my mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Einstein!” I exclaimed, happy to have found him. “I need your help! I need more of your sage wisdom, more of your advice..”
			</p>
			<p>
				He didn’t let me finish, he just made an impatient gesture with his hand and told me he was in a hurry.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But you don’t understand,” I said, tripping and falling over my words as I stumbled over an uneven square in the sidewalk.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m in danger! I feel like I need to know more, that what you told me was a dangerous kind of knowledge and that now I need to balance it out with more knowledge, another hint as to the puzzle of existence. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m going crazy and am in desperate need of help.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I absentmindedly gripped a clump of my hair in my hands, distressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” he said, placing a gentle hand on my shoulder. “You have an overactive imagination. That’s all. You don’t need any more ‘sage wisdom’ or anything else from me – you just need to calm down, and probably find a hobby or something. Now I need to go, I’m already late and I can’t afford to keep talking to you.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He began to walk away but I jumped on him, forcefully holding him back. He turned to me, his face a mask of anger, his eyes as small as slits and shooting fire in my direction.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You want help?” He said mockingly. “You’re in danger? Then tie your fucking shoes. That’s the only danger you’re in.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He huffed and wrenched his shoulder out of my grasp and began hurriedly walking down the street. I watched him go as I felt the lump in my throat growing and the tears about to break loose behind the floodgates.
			</p>
			<p>
				“And one more thing,” he said, calling out over his shoulder. “I’m not Einstein!”
			</p>
			<p>
				He rounded the corner, out of sight. Reality hit me like a brick wall and I looked down at the dirty gray concrete of the sidewalk, at the strange pattern of chewing gum that had been spit out in past decades, and at my unlaced shoes. My eyes grew wide as I understood what he had told me; that prescient, noble saint! Only a genius could have spotted what was directly beneath our noses; only a genius is capable of noticing that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes and calls him on it. Tears spurred out of sadness turned into tears of happiness and I whooped with joy, bending over to lace my shoes before running down the block to where Einstein had rounded the corner. I stood there, my hand over my eyes, looking for a sign of my eccentric muse. I saw a figure running off in the distance, an old leather briefcase tucked under one arm and a familiar bounce in his bushy, silver-black hair as he took long strides. I was amazed that a man of his age could run that fast, but then, remembering that he had somehow cheated the process of aging and death, my surprise dissipated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last time I spoke with him he had been waiting behind a bus bench, pacing up and down and looking around nervously. I knew it was me he was watching out for; I knew that to him I was a pest, a testament of the legacy he left behind, yet it was the same legacy he still paradoxically inhabited and made a living off of.
			</p>
			<p>
				I approached him with my hands up and palms out, as if to show him that I didn’t mean to do him any harm.
			</p>	
			<p>
				“Guten morgen, Herr Einstein,” I said, hoping to establish some rapport and wondering if I was pronouncing the German properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				“God damnit,” he muttered, looking me up and down. “What do you want? What is it now? Have you put your underwear on inside-out?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“No,” I replied, ignoring his quip. “I just came to tell you that I won’t bother you anymore. This will be the last time, I promise, and I just want to know one more thing.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He rolled his eyes, which surprised me. Just imagine, a man of his age and reputation, rolling his eyes!
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fine,” He said, grudgingly. “What is it? What can I do for you, O noble lunatic? What deep mysteries of life and the cosmos would you like to know now?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Ignoring his sarcasm, I gave him my plea.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” I began, searching for the right words. “I want you to tell me what the smartest thing you’ve ever done in your life was. Now it doesn’t have to be in your Einstein-specific life, it could be from your post-Einstein’s-death-life, if that makes any sense. It could be anything. So please tell me what it was, and take all the time in the world to think about it, and I promise I won’t pester you again. OK?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Einstein didn’t say a word, he just stood across from me with eyes like the narrowed slits of a medieval war helmet and slowly nodded his head.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You want to know what the smartest thing I’ve ever done in my life was?” He asked.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Yes,” I said, holding my breath.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fine.” He replied, peeved. “If you must know, what I’m going to tell you isn’t something I did, but rather something I <em>would</em> do, should I be given the opportunity to do it again, which I suspect I shall. What I’m going to tell you about is one of those irritating moments in life where you understand what you should have done just seconds or minutes after the opportunity has passed. In my case, it occurred in the very earliest moments of my life, and is what I have since recognized as my first regret. For the same reason we can know everything about the universe from simply studying the first few moments after the Big Bang, we can directly understand the rest of the course of our lives from actions that were made initially. Are you following me?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded meekly, spellbound.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I came to with no recollection of how I got there, no recollection at all. It was the first few moments after I came into existence, and, in the custom of the Viennese doctors who birthed me, I was taken to an observation room right next to the birthing room. This room was a tiny white room, more like a cabinet at shoulder height than a room, and heated to a lovely degree, although the floor was cold – I remember that part distinctly. Why the floor was cold, or why they even placed me on the floor, I have no idea – medical science has come quite far since those days, thanks in large part to Semmelweis’ contributions. Anyway, I was your typical baby: screaming and squalling and trying to make sense of the world, when all of a sudden I got a very distinct, unsettling feeling – a feeling I wasn’t used to then but am quite used to now: the feeling of being watched.”
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point he stopped for a moment to stare daggers at me, and I felt slightly uncomfortable for stalking him like some animal. I gulped loudly and he continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I wasn’t aware at the time that the unsettling feeling I was experiencing was an instinctual response to a potential predator left over from countless years of evolution, and so I turned out of pure instinct and looked over my shoulder to where a large, circular glass window was. I think it was the only one in the room. The glass was slightly convex, and so it lent a magnifying effect to anything that was on the other side of it, which, in my case, turned out to be one of the doctors. I saw a big, strange eye peering out at me, an eye which I couldn’t yet recognize as human, only extremely intelligent and somewhat foreboding. It was when this doctor opened the door and wrapped my naked body in a soft blanket that I realized that the moment had passed, and my opportunity had disappeared. I was handed into my mother’s arms, and we were both crying, but for entirely different reasons. For her, the life that stretched out before me was opportunity that she bequeathed me, ripe and full of potential; but as for me, all my opportunity lay behind me, lost in those first few minutes of existence. And here I am, standing before you as an old man who is still angry that he did not pick up the reins and change the course of his life.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don’t understand,” I said. “So you mean to say that you’re going to try this again in your next life, should you be born again and find yourself in the same situation?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Precisely,” he said impatiently, dismissing my naive question with a flamboyant wave of the hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What I’m going to do is very simple, should I find myself in that position once more. When I get born again – and like I mentioned earlier, I suspect I will – I’m going to pop out of my mother’s womb, wait for the doctors to sever my umbilical cord – and the reason for this is quite straightforward: if I was born with teeth I would simply bite it off and save the time, but no matter. The doctors would take care of the umbilical cord anyway, so why bother? Then I would yank the scissors used to sever my umbilical cord out of the doctor’s hands, jump up and stab him in the eye with them, then make my way over to my father and punch him directly in the jewels to make sure he wouldn’t be able to screw me like that again..”
			</p>
			<p>
				I watched in mute disbelief as Einstein gesticulated wildly and made all sorts of pounding, punching gestures, including stomping the ground repeatedly with one foot, as if he was fighting a number of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				“And if all goes according to plan, the hospital staff would recognize me as a demon and either lock me away or kill me. And I would never have to be born again. I would never have to suffer this, this hopeless, miserable ennui. Do you understand? And that’s the smartest thing I would have done, and that’s the best advice I can ever give you should you find yourself in that situation again.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded, never taking my eyes off of him, this genius who thinks on a completely different scale than common man. I put my hands in my pockets and slowly backed away, my eyes still glued to his face. <em>Genius reaches the greatest of heights and the lowest of lows,</em> I thought to myself, and I felt scared, not just for myself, but for him. Once I was a few feet away I took my hands out of my pockets and turned around, breaking into an all-out run.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Everything’s relative!” He called out after me, cackling like a madman.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Isn’t that what you wanted to hear? Everything’s relative, you motherfucker, and your shoelaces are still untied!”
			</p>
			<p>
				My foot stepped on a loose shoelace from my other foot and I was pitched forward, mid-stride and at full speed. And in the eternity between my head hitting the cold gray concrete and everything fading to black, I thought to myself <em>He’s right, that genius. He’s always right.</em>
