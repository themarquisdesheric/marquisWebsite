			<h2>((the hedonism manifesto))</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.”
				<br>
				-Oscar Wilde
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<span class="first">“What do you mean,</span> you feel guilty?” He shook his head, disgusted. “You think you’re the first person to ever feel guilt, to ever regret an action you made; to ever wish you could turn back time and take it all back, hit reset and start all over again?” He scoffed. “People spend their whole lives as prisoners of their emotions, perpetually wracked by stress, anxiety and the lesser emotions: guilt, regret and fear..”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stopped him mid-sentence. “But those feelings <em>must</em> serve some purpose; they can’t just be vestigial artifacts leftover from the dawn of man to plague us. Maybe the advent of guilt was a necessary development for human beings to coexist with each other. Maybe guilt was a safeguard for society so that when you screwed up once and hurt someone, you regretted it afterward so even though it initially happened, and you hurt the person, you learned from your mistakes and were less likely to repeat them in the future. Maybe that’s why it’s necessary to take guilt into account, and not just set it aside and ignore it as a <em>lesser emotion</em>, as you so eloquently called it.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Guilt? What about it? You have to change your worldview to accommodate your lifestyle. There are no second chances in this game, this existential trap. You sit there and beat yourself up over spilled milk – and for what? - when you can just as easily move on with your life. The weak minded person is a slave to his mind, subject to its whims and fancies and always the butt of its jokes. The truly strong man, then, has set guilt aside and developed a new form of conscience, a mindset free of regret; and he second guesses himself not out of doubt, but out of a strict methodology. He subjects himself to analysis: he is, in no uncertain terms, the subject of his own analysis.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He paused for a moment, his eyes lost in the clouds. A fire burned in them, a raging, burning beast that threatened to leap from his eyes and set others ablaze. I’d never seen such unbridled passion before, and I wondered what sparked it; what injustice had been committed however early on in his life to have necessitated his mode of thinking. I could tell he was passionate about this subject and truly believed that he benefited from it, although it was a passion that could very easily manifest itself in a self-destructive form. He continued:
			</p>
			<p>
				“These emotions, guilt and regret, they cloud the mind; they are the pangs of pain you feel when your mind bleeds. For the exact same reason you can determine whether or not a given system is efficient by the waste it produces is the same way you can determine whether or not your mind is efficient. In a perfectly efficient system there is no noise, there is no excess chatter, for noise is energy being lost. It is by this byproduct that you can conclusively determine that there exists a lapse in efficiency. Guilt is a representative of much the same principle. A perfectly efficient mind doesn’t bleed, it recycles that energy and uses guilt as a tool to its advantage, not to its disadvantage. The wise man, then, takes guilt into account but is not bound by it. He tallies it diligently: he studies the pros and cons, weighs the consequences and ramifications of his potential actions, and pores over his notes. He learns. He adapts. Guilt is the byproduct of an inefficient mind. You will have many such conflicts in your life, my dear boy, and this is only the beginning, I assure you. But it is up to you to choose how you will deal with them.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I listened, captivated at the sheer audacity of the words coming out of his mouth. He had a point, yes, but the idea of him actually living that philosophy was not only the mark of the true asshole, but borderline sociopathic. I was almost embarrassed to call him my friend.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Aren’t you worried about how your actions will affect other people? If you go on living like that; if you go on putting yourself on a pedestal and disregarding others, and then not even feeling guilty afterward… it’s almost inhumane. It’s disgusting, really. What you’re asking me to do is fundamentally wrong, and the first thing you should ask yourself any time you try to implement a new moral code, a new way of thinking is <em>what if everybody did this?</em> How would the world look if it wasn’t just one person doing this on an individual level, but everyone, on a mass scale?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed. “Don’t you get it? The only reality that really matters is your own. The only universe that exists, as far as I’m concerned, is my own. Forgive the cliché remark I’m about to make, but we’re all actors in this play, and those other people are <em>strangers</em>. The majority of them don’t care about you, wouldn’t give two shits if you were out there in the pouring rain changing the tire on your car, and wouldn’t even say hello if they walked past you on the street and you were the last two people left on Earth.” He stopped for a moment and took a deep breath, and I could tell he was proactively trying to relax his tone and remove the soapbox edge from his voice.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Now don’t get me wrong, there are good people out there, and that’s a wonderful thing. I think very highly of you, as I’m sure you thought very highly of me before this conversation. I fear you may lose some respect for me after this, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take to help you deal with this guilt issue. It’s both necessary and prudent to treat people with deference and respect so that you don’t go through life being a bitter, depressed old man who is always angry and treats others like trash. I may say all these terrible things, but understand that when I’m out in public I put on a wonderful facade and I’m charming and intellectual and nothing but nice – I may be a bitter, jaded old man on the inside, and I may think that people in their very nature are expedient, but understand that I constantly seek out those few angelic people who are <em>good</em> at heart, and worthy, and I aspire with all of my being, with every last shred of essence, to make them my friends. People like you. People who can take what I say and apply it in their own lives. And remember: I’m not telling you to go out there and be snotty and treat others like trash, what I’m saying is that you are the master of your own mind, and you shouldn’t have to be subservient to its flaws.”
			</p>
			<p>
				We sat in silence for a few minutes, watching the shadows dance on a nearby wall and listening to the digressions of our minds.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But aren’t you scared about the ramifications of thinking like that?” I asked, breaking the silence.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Aren’t you worried that if you think like that, you’re eventually going to slip into a hole that you yourself dug, and slowly and surely distance yourself from others and lose touch with the world?” I stuttered, tripping over my words in the flurry of emotions that had been triggered in my head.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Until we had this conversation, I was convinced you were a good person, and it’s not that I don’t now, but it’s frankly shocking to know that you think like that, and believe it, deep down inside. And I still think you’re a good person, and I’ve personally seen you go out of your way on numerous occasions to help strangers even though you scoff at the idea of Good Samaritans, and pass them off as a rare and prized commodity; mere anomalies in the grand scheme of society. Aren’t you scared about how the world would be if everyone only cared about themselves?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“The world will continue, my dear boy. It will endure, and it will forget about you, if it hasn’t already. What I’m teaching you is the art of adaptation, how to be a chameleon in human skin, how to make the most of your brief sojourn on this terrestrial plane. The prophets and mystics are wrong: <em>the end of the world will never come.</em> The end of <em>you</em>, however, will come. Play your cards well, my boy, for time is running out, and you are the master of your own mind:you manifest your own destiny.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“I wonder how much more of you there is beneath your flawless facade,” I said, stunned. “I’ve known you for years – years! - yet I never knew this aspect of your personality. You really are quite multifaceted. Pray tell, what other surprises do you have in store for me?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed. “After this conversation, you’d be hard pressed to believe that I could ever fall in love.” He laughed again, from the heart.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But I do fall in love. I fall in love over and over, brief forays into fantasy: I’ve loved more girls than you will ever know, or they will ever know. One should always be wary of the tricks his mind plays, of the delicate dance of pheromones and oxytocin, of falling into the abstract delusion that is love. Yet I find myself falling into the same trap nearly every day. I see a woman walk into a cafe; she is beautiful and her very essence screams to me, reaches out and tugs at my heartstrings, and I find myself fantasizing, for a delicious moment, about the potential romance we could have; the delicate brush of her hair against my face, her lips against mine, softer and more full than they have any right to be. Her touch is ecstasy, her movements the very definition of <em>allure</em>.” He paused for a moment, lost in thought.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Yet it doesn’t end there. The mind is a magnificent instrument, yet it is one that is in constant need of calibration. I imagine what would happen after the novel glow of a new romance dissipates. I think of our first fight. Is she rational, or is she liable to fall into hysterics? Do we kiss and make up, dragging the relationship on indefinitely, or do we decide to part ways, leaving us exactly where we started again: back at square one, in the cafe, me admiring the delicate swell of her breasts peeking out from beneath her cashmere sweater. And it’s hard, you know, to fall in love so many times and so easily. It tortures the soul. But even though we never talked, and we never got to know each other, when she smiles at me on her way out of the cafe I can’t help but feel a tremor in my heart. Will she remember me? Will she think of me, that young man in the cafe, and wonder to herself, <em>why didn’t I go over there and talk to him?</em> Will she go home to her boyfriend, and give him a kiss - more out of obligation than desire - and think, even just for a moment, about what it would be like to kiss my lips? Will she wonder, as I have wondered many times before, what it would be like to wake up next to me, to playfully fight over the sheets in the morning, to give me a kiss right on the tip of my nose and whisper <em>I love you</em> in my ear? Or will she walk out of that cafe and think that maybe she’s not as attractive as she had previously suspected, that maybe she’s losing her charm, her youthful sex appeal, and crave love with every cell in her magnificent body?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed again, but it wasn’t as musical as before; it was tinged with a melancholy bitterness that made me look at the floor and away from his eyes. He looked much older for a moment, and I wanted to reach out a hand and pat his shoulder, a show of support. We may come from entirely different families, you and I, but we’re brothers nonetheless.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I didn’t.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Wouldn’t that technically be a weakness? Wouldn’t that be going against your philosophy, letting your mind play tricks on you? All those false starts must take a toll on your emotional well being, or at the very least, wouldn’t they slowly desensitize you to love, real love, not mere fantasies?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He looked pensive for a moment.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Don’t think I haven’t considered that possibility. I’ve spent many a sleepless night pondering its effects and if I should let my mind wander that delicate arena like a lost puppy, always searching, sniffing around, hot on the trail of love and desire.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Listen,” I said, nervously changing the subject. “I’m scared of tomorrow, of a new day. When I think about the future, and the looming thought of old age, I get a kind of anxiety that’s hard to describe. Like a weight, a tension so real I can feel it, and it’s more than just tangible, it’s debilitating. Why do we have to be the only animals that fear death? Why can’t we just bumble along through life without worrying about it so much, losing so much time and energy to something so inevitable?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I sighed heavily, frustrated and sad.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fear? What of it? The things a man fears are almost never the ones he succumbs to, yet they rob him of his time, sapping away at his soul with an unprecedented diligence. It is a maladjusted conscience a man should fear, not life itself. Let life happen. Be more than a simple buoy bouncing in an endless sea. Find yourself, orient yourself, and take on the world. Throw caution to the wind. Get a taste of adventure. Go to foreign and exotic lands, and try foreign and exotic drugs with foreign and exotic people. We’re creatures of habit until the bitter end, and tell me, honestly, would you really want to go through life without any scars? Without those nights where you wondered, with all of your heart, if you would make it to see tomorrow? Embrace danger, embrace anything that holds a chance of killing you. For it is those things, and only those things, that pose any chance of liberating you from this meaningless, senseless ennui. Or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked at my watch. I wasn’t satisfied with my life. Not now and maybe not ever, but I did know one thing: I had to go. I had to leave, to throw myself into an entirely new environment and subject myself to new experiences. Time is running out, and we’re always one step behind it, running after it screaming like pedestrians chasing a moving bus: always hot on its tracks and almost there but never going quite fast enough to hop on board. It was time to grab the reins and shape my life, and as I left the cafe I couldn’t help but feel his last sentence resonate, playing over and over in my head like a broken record: <em>or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?</em>
