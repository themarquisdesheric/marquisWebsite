				<span class="first">About five years</span> ago, I left the twin suitcases of my sanity behind as I dove, headfirst, into the rabbit hole. I began to get inklings of something divine, caught glimpses and hints of a pattern of enormous consequence – a pattern so subtle that, to quote Calvino, it could escape the termite’s gnawing. At first I was overwhelmed with possibility: drunk on the prospect of catching onto the Bigger Picture, madly inspired by a dream not yet fully articulated but realized enough to have credence. It was what historians would refer to as a ‘frozen moment’ – a turning point, a decisive, defining moment in the course of my life. Since that day I have focused and refocused my sights on a very particular, very ambitious goal. It has spurred me to go to the other side of the world, and not just once. It has led me back in time, through books and drugs and the words of dead men, to pick up where they left off and serve a higher purpose, a shared vision. William Blake and Antoine de Lavosier had a similar experience. Both had mystical, life-altering experiences that would forever jar them out of ordinary consciousness. They articulated part of a law, part of a set of governing principles that I believe turns the gears of the world. They understood the first law of thermodynamics before it was recognized as a law, before our understanding of it changed our world. They caught onto one of the pillars of The Way The World Works, and by no simple act of happenstance. Both were elect, servants of a higher purpose.

				But verbalizing this is akin to doing nothing, nothing more than giving myself a nice, firm pat on the back. This is philosophical masturbation. But it is important to state since I have devoted my entire life to this endeavor, towards a better understanding of the things I feel actually matter, more than our silly jobs and rules and TV sets, more than the suits we wear and our noses held so high. The police officer with his badge. The judge with his gavel. The mother with her furrowed brow and the concerned look in her eyes. And I feel myself beginning to fall, tumbling and flailing down the rabbit hole, at an ever faster pace. I feel the gap between myself and others widening, yet paradoxically coming closer in bursts of clear, white light that illuminate the whole world for brief instants at a time. I find myself possessed by radical notions, things so clearly obvious and capital-t True that they are unshakeable and have come to define me. Borges, Calvino, and E.M. Cioran have had a similar experience. Laplace, Camus, and Feynman have had a similar experience. It would be cliché to mention Einstein, yet he too has had a similar experience. Hesse, Nietzsche, and Wilde have had similar experiences. Jung, of course, had this experience – and Jung, in my humble opinion, was one of the only men who ever actually woke up – a truly remarkable feat when one understands what an encumbrance Western society is to this sort of thing – to shun the customs of the world and everything that people, at large, hold so dear. The fools truly do love their chains.

				In my opinion, understanding the way the world works doesn’t only have to work in retrospect. I think that once you understand the way a system works, you can change it, and the world is no exception – I know that for a fact. And I’m not saying that I know the way the world works entirely – only that I’ve made huge strides in understanding, in getting closer to the bigger picture, and that I can prove it fundamentally. The foundations of my beliefs are so out of tune with the way people normally think that I’ve come to realize that verbalizing them is an act of war: people don’t want to be roused out of convention. No one wants to hear that they’re living a lie, and yes, this is pretentiousness at its finest. There’s an old saying that states that your answers are only as good as the assumptions underlying your questions, and I really believe in that. And I think that people aren’t ambitious enough in their thinking. I think that people don’t understand that they can and do change the world. I think people let their subconscious dictate their life, and then blame it on fate or god or a host of other stupid cop-outs instead of standing up and taking responsibility. I think that habit and convention are two of the biggest vestigial defects in humans, and that the majority of us are sleepwalking through our lives. I think time doesn’t quite exist as we think it does and mind-reading is, in fact, possible. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous and silly that people are scared of death for the simple reason that they falsely defined it. I believe in a duality of things, in blacks and whites with infinite shades of gray in between, and I think that the world is a big Rorschach inkblot: that everything, every object, every piece of art, every human being, every patch of blue sky, is a mirror held up to ourselves. I believe in the entropy of all things. I have unshakeable faith in several laws, and not man-made laws, but laws that existed before human beings came into the picture to sully a perfect world. The Golden Ratio, the Constructal Law, the laws of physics and quantum mechanics. Jungian psychology. The theory of the adjacent possible. I think that life and death are a series of rooms. I think that we take life too seriously and that there’s a lot to be said for throwing caution to the wind. I’m trapped in a paradox: I don’t think I’ll ever die, yet I’ve died before. I think that syntax is everything, and that I’m a meta-physician. I think that cancer is a form of life, but working in the opposite direction. I think that the universe is a hologram, and that twins are the living, breathing example of quantum entanglement. I’ve had startling epiphanies that I’m a figment of someone’s imagination, the very form and shape of their dream, and that when their alarm goes off in the morning and they have to go to work I’ll be really, really fucked because – poof! - I’ll be gone.

				But maybe I won’t quite disappear, maybe I’ll leave my words behind for some ambitious young man to find, thousands of years from now or the turn of a page from now, and maybe then I won’t hit the bottom of the rabbit hole but rather fall directly into that person’s mind, like a fully-formed philosophy with ramifications of a startling nature, and then maybe I’ll live like a saint in his mind, like some of the gods of my philosophies that I named above. Beautiful and irrefutable. And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.
