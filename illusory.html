				<span class="first">Dear Diary,</span><br><br>
				I found an unopened letter today. I had been walking to the coffee shop when I noticed it flapping in the wind, trapped against the curb as if it was left there just for me. I looked around, once, twice, just to make sure no one was looking, and then I picked it up, turning it over in my hands and searching for clues. It was a small envelope, the kind that you would expect to come with a Christmas gift or a bouquet of flowers. It wasn’t addressed to anyone, just sealed and nondescript. I decided to open it. A letter fell out, neatly folded with a picture on one side and writing on the other. The picture was a black and white illustration of a depressed-looking young man sitting at the edge of a dock, with a fishing line cast into the dark water below him. He didn’t look very hopeful. Far below the water, and unbeknownst to the young man, the fishing hook was caught in the hem of a young woman’s shirt. She lay on the ocean floor surrounded by corals and anemones, her long hair and regal skirt flowing with the waves. She looked so serene, so content as she lay there on the sea bed, and neither one knew the other existed. I turned the page over. The handwriting was beautiful, almost calligraphic in form and dark black like onyx. The first sentence said, <em>don’t ever hold yourself responsible for my actions.</em> Intrigued, I decided to keep reading. The second said, <em>it’s just that I’ve missed you so much…</em> It looked like it was written for a past lover, the prose implying that it was definitely not for relatives or a simple friend. It was an apology of sorts, a notice of departure; but for where, and to what end? I kept reading. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second paragraph was more telling. It began:
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>It takes a certain kind of courage to take those first few steps out onto the plank. To stand over the dark and churning waters of the unknown and to brace yourself for the icy-cold rush of the abyss, like a giant black hole trying to swallow you whole. To really believe that in every end there’s a new beginning, beautiful and novel and virgin-white.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I hesitated. I was reading something intensely personal, a confession that was a lifetime in the making. Curiosity overpowered guilt and I continued, the futile screams of my erstwhile conscience falling upon deaf ears. Somehow I knew that I would pay dearly for this, that sleep would not come so easily anymore and that I would spend long nights alone, pondering the suffering and torment of another, bearing the weight of being the sole witness to their pain.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>We don’t all progress at the same rate, it said, some of us are faster, some slower, and some don’t belong here at all. I, to my chagrin, am of the latter category. My life so far has been that of a fish out of water. The entirety of my existence has been a prolonged suffering, a perpetual sigh of discontent. I am not indelible. As Camus once said, “there is only one truly serious philosophical question, and that is suicide. Deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy. All other questions follow from that.” Camus, genius that he was, managed to persevere until the age of 46 when he was killed in a car accident alongside a close friend – 46! - I call this thinly-veiled serendipity, for every suicide knows that it is much better to be killed at the hand of another than to die by your own hand. Ten years after his death, a previously unpublished work of his was posthumously released. Ironically enough, the title he chose for it was A Happy Death. I, however, have not resigned myself to waiting for death cowering and unawares. There is a solemn dignity in suicide, a dignity that the Japanese Samurai of yesteryear relished and reverently called seppuku: the art of dying with honor.</em>

				I realized that I was clutching the letter with trembling hands. My palms were sweaty, and the hair on my arms was standing on end, like little brown palm trees sticking out of sand-dune goosebumps. I gulped loudly, and looked around again. No one was watching. It was like I tuned out the world; I hadn’t even been paying the slightest attention to what was going on around me. I felt foolish, standing out there in the bright, warm sunlight of a beautiful spring day, reading of someone’s heartbreak and despair. <em>They must have felt so cold while writing this,</em> I thought. <em>So cold, and so, so alone.</em> I didn’t know the person, or if it was even written by a male or female, but I felt for them. Empathy is one of the stronger emotions we’re subject to as humans, and I felt like I had been laid out, prostrated by its sheer power. Maybe it’s because we all want to be martyrs, but I felt like throwing myself in front of the train, taking a bullet for this person, or at the very least embracing them and whispering <em>everything’s going to be alright, just you wait and see.</em> The helplessness I felt was overwhelming, and as I’m sure most recipients of such notes feel, I felt completely and utterly useless. I was an afterthought, a brief notation on the bottom of the page in a history book that wasn’t relevant anymore. Their life was over. The case was closed. There was nothing to do but wait and reflect. Inconsolable in my grief, I continued reading.
			</p>

				<em>Years and years I stood on that plank, watching, wondering what it would be like. I wondered if it was right to embark on such a quest when I knew how much it would hurt my family and friends. After much deliberation and many a sleepless night, I came to the conclusion that this was the only choice I had. I spent a lifetime living in a world lighter than air, a world where I was, unfortunately, the air. The simple truth was that I had had enough. I didn’t want to be at the forefront, or the background, or at all. I felt like a child who had spontaneously been given a gift. It was beautiful at first: an act of love, yes, but it came with its own set of responsibilities, which in turn became burdens, and every once in a while I couldn’t help but wonder if it was worth all the trouble. I couldn’t give it back – that would be entirely unacceptable. No, I had to put it somewhere, to stash it in a place where it wouldn’t easily be found. It wasn’t how I was brought up, or the way I’d spent my time, because the fact of the matter was that I loved living, and I didn’t think it would simply end at death. I had always felt like an outsider, like a traveler who has returned home after years of exploring fascinating and exotic places, only to find home as a familiar map filled with strange faces and even stranger customs. I knew the place intimately, and every corner held a story from my childhood, but it wasn’t mine, and I wasn’t the same person. I was an actor in an unfamiliar play, and the problem wasn’t that I didn’t remember my lines - I did remember my lines, I had simply been miscast. The people looked like me, yet we were not the same. I felt as if I had an invisible barrier around me, barring me from fully immersing myself in society, and I sat behind it like a sullen king, impervious to the horrors of the world. I saw evil, and I took note of it, but it did not change me. I saw happiness, undoubtedly, but the heart-warming aspect of it was lost, diffused against my impenetrable facade…</em>

				Something fluffy and moist attacked my leg, and I kicked it out of instinct. It yelped, and a woman yelled at me for kicking her dog. I apologized and told her that it had startled me, and accusingly asked her what was she doing creeping around here anyway? I felt like I was losing touch with the world, like the more I read of the letter the more of my sanity I was losing. I hadn’t even heard the woman or her dog approach me. She muttered something about red eyes and smoking, and I briefly considered telling her exactly how I felt: that they were tears, real ones, and that there were larger matters at hand than her stupid chihuahua. I thought better of it. The whole situation made me empathize with the author more, because he was right, people do overstep their lines and don’t even feel guilty about it, and those of us who don’t want to hurt others but simply ourselves can’t because of some age-old dogma about suicide being a sin. Maybe the world <em>would</em> be better off without us. It was an uncharacteristic thought, and I made a mental note to not get sucked into the same maelstrom as the unfortunate author of the letter, but it reverberated and rang true. The Earth would look so <em>different</em> without people! So much more natural and pure, and even the rape of Nanking was nothing compared to the rape of Earth by her parasitic humans. I walked further down the road, in the opposite direction of the scolding woman, until I reached a quiet spot in the shade beneath an oak tree. The letter was the most interesting thing I’d ever read, and I hungered for it, wanting more like some junkie desperately waiting for the next fix. Anything tempered by the loss of a human life is worth infinitely more, and it would be no small tragedy if it went overlooked.

				<em>…for even as I met you, and we got to know each other, I always had one foot on the other side, one foot in those dark, lapping waters. Just know that I held on for you, for it was you who showed me the beauty of a new day and the promise of tomorrow. It was you who took me by the hand and told me that everything works out, you just have to wait for it and help it along sometimes. I’m sorry I only heeded your advice halfheartedly, and I hope you can use it as consolation for yourself in my absence. The truth is that I’ve always loved you, much more than I have ever loved myself. You were the spark that kept me going, the unshakeable little voice that should have been my own, but wasn’t. What a different day tomorrow would be if that was my own voice urging me along this uphill battle, what a different world it would be…</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I couldn’t help it. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, and I didn’t care who saw me sob and moan, I didn’t care about the people driving by who were undoubtedly pointing and wondering; all I cared about was making sure that my tears didn’t fall directly onto the handwriting, onto the last will and testament of this person’s existence, with its beautiful flourishes and swirls. My nose was running and I looked like a wreck. I sat down on the cold dirt, wiping my nose on the back of my hand and leaning against the tree trunk, my body gently trembling, my mind one big churning whirlpool of agony. Were there not enough flourishes and swirls in your life to keep you going? I don’t think I had known true pain until that moment, and it hurt so much more because it wasn’t even physical pain, it was a mental anguish that cut straight through to the heart, as if there was no skin or muscle or bone over it to protect it. I steadied myself, taking deep, numbered breaths and waited until my heart rate stopped red-lining and slowed to a normal beat. I exhaled, bracing myself, and continued reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>…it’s time I let go, darling, for the hour is quickly approaching. It’s time I jumped into the water and swam in a sea of blissful intangibility, finally free of my terrestrial bonds. I’ll be like Ur drifting through the cosmos, experiencing firsthand the esoteric mechanics of death and the divine beauty of metamorphosis. Life is too corporeal, too trite an endeavor to needlessly perpetuate, and I find myself out of patience and out of chances. Let those who seek know that this is my pursuit of happiness in action, the fates be damned. There could be ten hells worse than this one, but I’ll take my chances.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				It was signed with a resolute <em>– S.D.</em> The futility of my situation angered me beyond words, and I clutched my hair. I wanted to scream. Even the hyphen seemed to imply, mathematically speaking, that you were removing yourself from the equation of life. Who were you, S.D., that you suffered so? Had I known I would have thrown you a life preserver, something, anything, to prevent you from diving into those illusory depths! You will haunt me my whole life, you who couldn’t keep up with the world and its indiscriminate, breakneck pace. And even now I find myself pacing the halls, trying to busy myself, trying to keep myself from being sucked into your contagious misery. You beautiful, tortured stranger. How I feel for you, how I regret your loss.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet I find myself on a quest not unlike yours, for it is my responsibility now, my burden to locate your past love and ensure that your letter reaches the right hands. It would be no small tragedy if your anguished words were to fall upon deaf ears, and it is up to me to ensure that they do not. Know that in forfeiting your life, you have given my own some small measure of purpose, an additional meaning, and for that I will be forever grateful. Consider myself indebted to your shade, O brave explorer, and may you find whatever it is you were searching for.
