			<h2>((the scream))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">The subway rocked gently</span> as it left Queens and headed off in the direction of Manhattan. All the seats were taken, and the aisles were crowded with human flotsam and jetsam: the elderly clutching their rolling backpacks, single mothers with children in tow, teenagers unselfconsciously gossiping with loud rock music blasting from headphones hanging around their necks. I sat in my seat quietly, taking everything in with a curious eye and subconsciously eavesdropping. I looked out of the window at the romantic old buildings that lined New York’s crowded streets, beautiful facades from the previous century that once sported a spotless gray luster but had been blackened by decades of pollution from a living city. I looked at the years of grime painted across those silent buildings, and at the graffiti that seemed to sprout up around the bases like a burgeoning fungus, an urban mold that was testament to the unbreakable will of man. And I had the strangest thought while looking out of those windows: <em>nothing seemed to make sense anymore.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				The people, the signs, the storefronts – for what? I felt my heartbeat quicken and I breathed nervously, suddenly anxious with a yearning I couldn’t quite describe. From the raised tracks I saw people milling about below me, getting jostled and bumping into one another on the city streets, nothing more than ants in a glorified ant farm. And I couldn’t help but wonder what they were doing here, what I was doing here. Life suddenly seemed so trivial, so banal. I looked at the billboards, at the street signs, at the policemen in their silly blue uniforms. They were all directing us where to go, what to like, what to do. Buy this. Do that. Red means stop, green means go. And it seemed so silly, seeing all those people, seemingly autonomous creatures of free will, each with their own agenda and their own life, all going nowhere. All with something to do, but all of it ultimately meaning nothing in the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began to panic. The subway lurched to a stop and I got off in lower Manhattan. I thrust my hands in my pockets and set off at a quick pace down the city’s labyrinthine streets. The people of the city stopped and stared at me with apprehensive eyes, as if sensing a cancer in their midst. I stopped to tie my shoes and people kept bumping into me, almost knocking me off of my feet. Everyone was rushing somewhere, yet I knew they had nowhere to go. I wanted to stop everyone, to shake them and scream <em>but where are you really going?</em> Words and symbols were everywhere: emblazoned on clothing, painted across buildings, and deeply ingrained into everything around me; all for naught. What did all of this mean, all these uniforms and signs and Wall Street executives running around like so many scared penguins? What did we, as a people, mean? None of our dramas and friendships and science actually means anything in the end, and I couldn’t help but think of a time when I was younger, much younger than today, when a friend of mine told me about one of his most cherished memories with his father.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he was just a little boy, my friend explained to me, he would wait until it rained so he could have outings with his father. He and his father would don rain jackets and big rubber boots and go outside to stomp on helpless snails. They would wait until dusk, when all the snails would come out, lured by the rain, and they would run about gaily and laugh and stomp every snail they could find with a satisfying <em>crunch.</em> He would pray for rain, this friend of mine, so that he and his father could bond over the massacre of hundreds of snails in under an hour. I remember him telling me that story plain as day, without a guilty conscience or anything of the like; only the warm glow of reminiscing about a fond memory decorating his face. I remember being horrified; that sick, wretched feeling of <em>but that’s so wrong</em> deep in my gut, and feeling so sick I almost threw up. This friend, he didn’t understand my reaction at all. He didn’t see it as anything wrong. “But they’re just snails,” he told me. “They can’t feel anything. They’re not human.” And I remember crying that night, crying and thinking to myself that if we’re all snails coming out in the rain, then I hope to god there aren’t any humans around to stomp on us. It’s years later now, and I still feel the same way, and I still get that helpless, pathetic feeling inside when I wonder <em>but what if we’re all just snails?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				And I had that same feeling as I stood there in Manhattan, skyscrapers towering above me with bright neon lights boasting <em>but look how far we’ve come, look how much we’ve achieved as a people.</em> And I brushed it off with the confidence of a prophet who knows his visions are true, and I couldn’t help but think to myself <em>even the Tower of Babel fell in the end.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				“Can’t you see?” I screamed out. People stopped for a moment and looked in my direction, then continued walking and paid me no heed. I fell to my knees and wailed unselfconsciously in between the throngs of people who were busy going about their day. I had had enough. The realization dawned on me that I finally knew what the Russians were speaking of when they used the word <em>toska</em>. I was the man who Munch had painted in <em>The Scream</em>, and I couldn’t take it any longer – I couldn’t let the charade keep going.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are we doing here?” I cried out to no one in particular. “When it all really comes down to it, what are you rushing for? Don’t these advertisements sicken you? Don’t these uniforms and made-up rules disgust you?”
			</p>
			<p>
				A crowd began to form around me, curious passersby stopping to see what all the fuss was about. I began to feel light-headed, and forgotten images from my childhood swam in my mind’s eye. I loosened my tie. I saw a man with a suit walking by, and I spat in his direction, disgusted. I balled my tie up and threw it at his feet.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Don’t you want to do something meaningful with your life? Are we really just destined to exist, creatures of a brief season, and then disappear like fireflies in the winter?” My head hung loosely on the end of my neck, defeated. I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to feel good again.
			</p>
			<p>
				The man in the suit quickened his pace, his shifty eyes looking around nervously. No one met his gaze. An older man with a ruddy face stepped out of the river of people streaming past me. His voice was as scratchy as the five o'clock shadow that lined his cheeks, and he spoke as if he was accustomed to having a cigarette dangling out of his mouth.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are you complaining about? Everything is in order, can’t you see? We have it so good here; we have convenience stores and hot dog vendors, pretty women and an entertainment industry solely concerned with keeping you entertained. This is <em>America</em>, this is the capital of the world!”
			</p>
			<p>
				The older man’s drawl confirmed my suspicion that he lacked any semblance of an education or inherent intelligence, and I shook my head in quiet disgust.
			</p>
			<p>
				“He’s right!” a nearby hot dog vendor exclaimed, pushing his way to the front of the crowd and slapping the older man heartily on the back. “Nothing cheers you up like a hot dog, nothing!” He looked around for support, arms outstretched, palms up. A few people clapped. The hot dog vendor looked strangely surprised, as if he expected more of a standing ovation.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Who can think of hot dogs at a time like this?” I wailed, amazed that the sheep were so happy being fenced in. “We’re all playing a big game of king-of-the-hill,” I said. “We’re all simply fighting to get to the top, pushing others down so we can reach the peak, and for what? What are we going to do once we’re up there, are we going to try and sell the view to the highest bidder?”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Hey!” Someone shouted. It was a young woman, pointing her umbrella at me like a long, indignant finger – an accusing, irritating gesture. “What are you so unhappy about? Everything is in order, everything is as it should be. You wake up in the morning, you go to work. You leave work, you go to bed. What’s so bad about that? Think about how much worse people have it in other countries before you start pissing on your own.”
			</p>
			<p>
				There was sporadic applause. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and hearing.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What did you want to do with your life?” I said to the woman with the umbrella, challenging her.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What did you <em>really</em> want to do? If you had a time machine and could go back to the you when you were seven years old, would your dreams still be in tune? Or would the seven-year-old you laugh in your face about being a lawyer or a banking executive, or any of those other highbrow titles that simply mean <em>this is how I’m wasting my life and I’m proud of that fact, thank you very much.”</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				The crowd fell silent for a moment and I reveled in the glow of a minor victory. A wizened old man pushed his way to the front of the crowd with obvious difficulty, his breath heavy and strained by the time he made it to the front. The crowd watched him approach with wary eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“So what would <em>you</em> do if you had the choice?” He asked, waggling a long, wrinkled finger in my direction. “Would you want to be out picking berries all day and wandering the forests like a gosh-darned <em>hippie</em>?” As if to emphasize the last word, he spat a thick glob of brownish phlegm into the street. There was a fire in his eyes that hadn’t been seen since the second world war, and the crowd reacted as one, momentarily looking away, disgusted.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s what I thought,” he said, mistaking the crowd’s reaction as agreement and beaming unselfconsciously. He stood up straighter, his chest puffed out and his chin raised with a defiant, haughty air, and for a brilliant moment he was a soldier once again.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m not saying we should return to the forests,” I began, treading carefully. “I just want the ennui of our daily lives acknowledged. I don’t want to keep living my life walking past the same faces every day without ever meeting their gaze or saying hello, or, god forbid, actually sitting down and speaking with them, seeing what these strangers, these humans who look so much like me are all about.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“We’re talking right now, aren’t we?” The woman from before said, clearly agitated. “And look how well this is going.” She waved a hand at the glum countenances of the assembled crowd. “All smiling faces,” she added sarcastically.
			</p>
			<p>
				I ignored her barbed statement and continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How can you go on living like this?” I screamed, frustrated that no one felt my existential dread.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How can you go on stumbling through life jumping through hoops and ladders, always conforming, always placing yourself in neat little boxes with pretty little labels and never asking questions?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I paused and took a deep breath. “When you thought about your life, did you ever expect it to turn out like this? Did you wake up one day and think to yourself <em>maybe I don’t want to be an astronaut after all, maybe what I really want to be is a marketing executive?</em> We live in a society scared of its own shadow, a society where convention is the only rule and there are no exceptions. Is that what you wanted?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Well, I don’t know about you,” the hot dog vendor said, “but does anyone want a hot dog? They’ll cheer you right up and you’ll be back on track in no time, no time at all!” He looked around again, but no one clapped this time. He turned and walked off down the street, his shoulders hunched, muttering something unintelligible under his breath.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” the woman from before began, “I’m very proud of my job and my life – very proud. And you know what bothers me the most about this world? It’s that everyone’s so thankless. People like you – complainers, never actually helping benefit society, just criticizing it. Maybe you should go out there and try to change the world instead of just standing on your little soap box here trying to demoralize people and make them question their existence. Maybe you should just go find something to do with your pathetic little life, and stop trying to obstruct those who do know what they’re doing. Maybe then you’ll get the answers you’re looking for.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked at her with the patient, knowing eyes of a mother who’s about to console a distraught child.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Do you know what I think?” I said. “I think you’re going to be in exactly the same position I’m in now, although it might take you a few years to reach it. And I honestly can’t tell you if you’ll reach it by ascending to a higher truth, or if you’ll reach it by plummeting down to the hallowing depths of rock bottom, but I know you’ll be where I am now, and you’ll immediately recognize it for what it is. And when that happens I want you to think of me, to picture my face and my pain, and use the philosophy you used today to try and console yourself. And I want you to see if that works, because you can only lie to yourself for so long before you realize that your very existence is a lie.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“You’re disgusting,” she said. “Vermin. The scummiest of the scum. You’re trying to proselytize good, happy people into your depressing school of thought, and for what? So you could go and ruin everything we humans worked so hard to achieve?” She scoffed and walked away, visibly upset. I wasn’t concerned. I knew it would catch up with her one day.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the crowd were murmuring amongst themselves and soon began to dissipate. I sat down on the cold, dirty sidewalk and cradled my head in my hands. And as the tears started falling, I thought of my friend and his father, and how they bonded over a blatant massacre. And just like my friend before me, I prayed for rain. I prayed for a biblical bout of rain that would wash away our sins along with our civilization. And even the word <em>civilization</em> itself was an oxymoron; there was nothing civil at all about civilization. And as my body heaved and shuddered, I dreamed of a huge wave, unlike anything that had ever come before it, a Goliath of the seas. And as I sat there, I couldn’t help but notice a sound like running water, like the floodgates had broken and all hell was about to break loose.
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked over and saw the biggest wave I had ever seen, a true monster that towered over the buildings as if they were made out of Legos; and as it curled back to peak height all the sound disappeared, sucked into its gaping maw. People around me began to scream, but it was too late as the buildings crumpled and the streets became aqueducts, swallowing people and cars alike with terrible speed as the wave coursed through the city, spitting and churning and sweeping everything up. Terrified people ran past me as the wave slowly made its way closer, some jumping clear over me. I sat there watching the whole thing, awestruck, not knowing if to believe it or not. Was this really happening? As the wave came closer and closer, I couldn’t help but think of the woman from before, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was happy with how her life had turned out, if she’d gone to her watery grave pleased and with no regrets. And as the wave curled back and towered above me, about to come crashing down, I couldn’t help but smile a smile of relief, of thanks. Today the rain washed the snails away instead of bringing them out into the open. And it’s funny how the world works. Maybe there is a god above us, and the same story repeats itself every few millenia. Maybe every building and skyscraper in this cursed city was a Tower of Babel in itself, and had to be destroyed. I smiled contentedly in the face of absolution. <em>Maybe next time we’ll get it right,</em> I thought, happy to finally know how the world worked. <em>Maybe one day we’ll get it right.</em>
