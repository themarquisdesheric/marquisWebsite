			<h2>((a fragment of a hallucination))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">You sit there</span> in your chair next to the desk and feel yourself slipping, falling; a drifting away so slow and certain that it’s more like a creeping, like a caterpillar slowly climbing down the stem of a leaf or an aged priest descending the steps of the old bell tower, his white-tipped fingers clutching the handrail like a tenuous safety net, the very epitome of frailty hanging on to what little is left of life.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it’s not his life he’s clutching onto, but rather his life is clutching onto his body: hanging on, not certain if letting go would mean death or a worse fate – be it the passing of sanity from those safe shores of convention, of all that he was accustomed to and what he thought his life was – or if it would mean something else entirely; if that <em>something</em> that was pulling at him so steadily and surely – was that not the very specter of Death reaching out at him from the shadows? Pulling at him with long, raking fingernails, clutching at his skin; and already the whites of his eyes are exposed and unmistakeable, and the fear, <em>the fear</em> is in him now, and he feels himself letting go, sinking, thinking <em>no, no, no! Not yet, not now!</em> But it’s too late and he’s already falling, drifting away, losing himself piece by irretrievable piece..
			</p>
			<p>
				And as you sit there in your chair watching the old priest in your mind’s eye, you realize with a feeling not unlike fear that you too are slipping away, drifting further and further away from your body towards a destination unknown. You’re up there in limbo, floating and trying to paddle; your arms and legs flailing wildly, clumsily flapping like crippled wings and not making any headway. And it’s then that you think back to that nameless old priest, that ancient of days who is drifting out there just like you are, both of you nothing but conscious motes of flotsam and jetsam in an endless sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				You grit your teeth as you see a figure approaching, but perhaps <em>figure</em> isn’t the right word, for this is little more than a shimmer in the air, an apparition, a point of singular awareness - of consciousness undoubtedly - but who, and from where?
			</p>
			<p>
				And it’s with a wry grin that you realize that it’s the old man from your dream-scape, the one who was descending the stairs so slowly and surely so as not to slip (lest he fall to his death); his broken body already sprawled at the bottom of the bell tower, his chest weakly rising and falling. His eyes are glazed over, he is a clock about to run out of time. And already the ravens and vultures are circling overhead, their piercing shrieks filling the air; their sharp, hooked beaks patient and waiting for that final breath, that signal to go ahead and drop from the air like intelligent hail; claws with cruel points eager to rend into warm flesh.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as you make your way through the stars like Ur journeying through the cosmos, the realization dawns on you that your body is like a freight train, a vessel so deeply rooted in habit and convention that it maintains its course at all costs - because the terrain off the tracks is rugged and treacherous, uncharted, insane – and you don’t particularly want to find out how far the depths of insanity go.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it’s with a certain exhilaration that you realize that your mind is free to roam, able to break free of its earthly bonds and the penitentiary of the body (that paradoxical lock-and-key), and is finally able to rid itself of that unnerving handicap of physicality and tangibility, of limited perception.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s with this final haughty thought that you leave the mainland of sanity and safety behind and dive headfirst into a sea of blissful intangibility, into the alluring depths of pure, unadulterated insanity. And it’s here that you find yourself pleasantly surprised to discover that insane wasn’t <em>insane</em>, wasn’t all strait jackets and white walls. It was deeper than that: beautiful, and full of color, not darkness; effervescent and luminous, and shimmering with the kind of color that paints the world when the sun sets in August: pastel hues with a mother-of-pearl sheen, that same explosion of color you find yourself in when looking at Petker’s paintings. It is this same kind of color that reminds you of your dreams; where the blues spill into the reds and the yellows burst into the greens, where the edges melt and slip into each other to the point where they’re edges no longer but rather abstractions, convergence points, whirlpools and eddies like the kind that form between the shallows and the depths – and not just bright colors, but rich, dark colors as well: the dark earth tones of a Bavarian forest, the rooftop cross of a Portugese church outlined against the black of the mountains and the pallid moon. The light which falls in such delicate moonbeams through a canopy of mist, painting the city as the land of the dead; it is this, these words, fragments, associations, hallucinations – these are how the waters of insanity look.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fog that encircles you thins out and turns into a mist of sorts, but only momentarily, for in front of your very eyes it turns into words, a beautiful Cyrillic script that looks like a cross between Greek and English, Hebrew and Russian. You watch it shifting and shimmering in front of you as if it was hanging in the wind, and you notice with a marked curiosity that it has a distinct texture not unlike stained glass, a pattern so sublime that you know with absolute certainty (although you don’t quite know how) that it is of divine origins.
			</p>
			<p>
				Holding your breath you lean forward, incredulous, trying to get a closer look. Is that smoke you see, streaming out from behind the letters? You cough and sputter, and the smoke has filled your lungs, but it doesn’t choke you so much as fill you with the strangest of feelings, as if you had ingested a color, as if you were able to perceive the taste of indigo and the separate, distinct, not unpleasant taste of orange, a color that compliments the previous taste of indigo much like chocolate does vanilla, and suddenly you find yourself in the ice cream parlor down the street from your parent’s home, six years old again and happier than ever; the rich, decadent taste of chocolate smeared upon your lips, and the half-finished ice cream cone in your little hand – you are smiling, you are content.
			</p>
			<p>
				And somewhere in the sky above you, a certain old man is doing the cosmic dance against a backdrop of stars, kicking his feet this way and that, doing the jitterbug waltz to the beat of a thousand tribal drums played by long-dead Aztec warriors, the finest regiment Montezuma’s armies had to offer. And as you watch him, enchanted by his deliberate movements and the way that the stars and time seem to bend and respond, you realize that he’s calling something, summoning a creature of Heaven and Earth, and without word or explanation you see the caterpillar from before floating towards you like a creature from the deep seas until it reaches you and stops directly in front of you, face-to-face.
			</p>
			<p>
				You look into its black eyes and see a darkness so profound that it looks like death, like the black of the void.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Did I die?</em> You ask the caterpillar, scared of the answer you’ll receive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>No,</em> the caterpillar answers, <em>you just had a very vivid dream that you were once alive.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				You look around at the endless space that encompasses you, at the stars twinkling from their cold perches, and already everything is fading, changing back into that transfiguring mist, and you feel memory leaving you, pouring out of your mind-vault like a torrent. You try with all your might to remember what your face looked like, but you realize with a disturbing, sinking feeling that you can’t quite remember which one you were: the young man or the old priest, or someone else entirely.
