			<h2>((a hallucination trapped in amber))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="first">There is a vision</span> I had years ago that fills me with such longing and despair that it dampens my brightest of moods, a revelation granted to me by the gods that to this day both burdens and enlightens me; a celestial summons that forces me to ruminate upon my own temporal existence. Understanding it, I fear, remains a Sisyphean feat.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>There was no context:</em> it was as if I had suddenly been deposited into an intimate meadow in the remote forests of Siberia. I remember how the mist, strangely sentient, slowly spread apart as I approached, exposing the cobblestone path that weaved its way through the tall grass and dense foliage towards the bleak gray sky and foothills of distant mountains. A passing breeze brought rows of glittering raindrops like an emerald wave, and then - as if perfectly commonplace - they froze, suspended in the cold air; each one a divine multifaceted mirror, each facade a microscopic disciple of reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				I stood there entranced, a little boy facing the adversities of the world, a prisoner in my ethereal hell. It seemed time had stopped underneath that unforgiving sky, and all that was left was the pits.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a clamor of cymbals as the hypnotic fog began a dance, one that started as sweetly and elegantly as a rose but gathered speed and intensity as it tore through the raindrops, galvanizing them into motion. They paired off, waltzing and spinning between the ornate balustrades of a royal wedding reception; the marriage of my only daughter, and it was here, you see, that I find myself today; a much older man now than I was then, and singing an altogether very different tune. I know now that youth is wasted on the young just as wisdom is wasted on the old, and I am no better a man for it, just older and jaded and more tired.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes I can’t help but think that perhaps it wasn’t a vision I had all those years ago, but one that I am having: for time blew past in such a shudder while I stared, lost in those magnificent evanescent raindrops, that it seems as though I lost my youth to the cruel Sirens of time. It is youth’s felicity as well as its insecurity to think that such trapdoors of time are too cruel a card to play; and it is age, not reason, that shows me that my life is a house of cards that is being blown away in the wind, one by one, like leaves being shed from a tree, little minutes being sheared off by the indiscriminate clippers of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				And just like that – <em>poof!</em> – it’s gone.
