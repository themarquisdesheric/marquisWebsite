        <span class="open-quote">“Fear? What of it?</span> The things a man fears are almost never the ones he succumbs to, yet they rob him of his time, sapping away at his soul with an unprecedented diligence. It is a maladjusted conscience a man should fear, not life itself. Let life happen. Be more than a simple buoy bouncing in an endless sea. Find yourself, orient yourself, and take on the world. Throw caution to the wind. Get a taste of adventure. Go to foreign and exotic lands, and try foreign and exotic drugs with foreign and exotic people. We’re creatures of habit until the bitter end, and tell me, honestly, would you really want to go through life without any scars? Without those nights where you wondered, with all of your heart, if you would make it to see tomorrow? Embrace danger, embrace anything that holds a chance of killing you. For it is those things, and only those things, that pose any chance of liberating you from this meaningless, senseless ennui. Or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?<span class="end-quote">”</span>

      <blockquote>
        “It looks like I’m back at square one again, musing about life with as much hope as a suicidal cynic with a finger on the trigger. There’s quite a schism between reality and fallacy, but which looking glass do we choose to look through most often? Upon scrutinizing, you’ll find a twisted survival mechanism innate to all of us – a hope delusion – and we’re all victims to its perpetuity schemes. Self preservation sounds great on paper, but if we’re all living in the misery of the present, with our wars and hate and oppression, why persist?”<br>
        –Taky–dyzamof

      <p>
        <span class="open-quote">It’s six o'clock</span> and I’m already late for my first meeting with the psychiatrist. I’m walking through a corridor lined with sterile white walls, where the air is stale and the few passersby I see don’t smile. Neutral colors and over–medicated shells of humans are the only company I have in this depressing environment, and I wonder why they didn’t at least try to make a mental health center look more optimistic. The permanent residents of the facility gaze at me with vacant eyes, and I’m glad that I came here of my own accord.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrive at Room 103 and find a nondescript door with a simple plaque stating DR. GROSCH. Scuff marks line the bottom and it appears to be slightly ajar. I begin to 	knock and the force of it pushes the door open; it glides forward slowly and quietly on greased hinges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I step inside and find the psychiatrist waiting, but <em>psychiatrist</em> doesn’t quite seem like the right word. He’s impish and slight, with what looks to be a perpetual sneer – not necessarily a bad characteristic, but it looks like he’s privy to something that the rest of the world doesn’t know – and it amuses him to no end.
      </p>
      <p>
        His three–piece suit has that forlorn look to it, as if it only truly lived when it was considered hip, and is depressed and world–weary to have fallen out of style. He leans forward with his hand outstretched, and I shake his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Are you familiar with Rorschach inkblots?” the psychiatrist asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s no introduction, nothing more than a handshake and a very direct question. I briefly wonder if this is a technique commonly employed by psychiatrists to catch their patients off guard, or if he’s simply trying to make up for lost time.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes. I’m meant to tell you what I see – what I think I see, at least – in these inkblots, and then you take notes and act like you can make sense of these things.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychiatrist pauses, momentarily caught off guard. The smile at the corner of his mouth grows until it expands into a laugh, the kind of laugh that sends chills down your spine. I wasn’t exactly thrilled about having a psychiatrist who put me on edge, but figured that I just had to get used to him first. Foreign people tend to be eccentric anyway, and I couldn’t quite pin down where he was from.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’ll give you several of these inkblots,” he began. “You study them, take as long as you want, and tell me what you see. What images fill your mind’s eye, what memories are triggered, that sort of thing. What we’re looking for here is <em>significance</em>.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He slides one of the inkblots from his pile across the table at me and I pick it up. It looks like a cross between a picture of a cat and a Jackson Pollock painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It looks like a cat,” I stammer.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Just a cat?” He asks, “tell me, how does that make you feel?”
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the typical psychiatrist response I should have expected, but I felt comfortable with him. It was as if we weren’t having a therapy session at all and were instead having a one–on–one improv session, a contest of sorts to see which of us held the upper hand. If this was to be a test of guile, I intended to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Well, it makes me feel good. Powerful. Life is all about playing cat–and–mouse and overcoming obstacles, attaining goals, that sort of thing. Cats are stealthy, lithe creatures. Intelligent. I feel like I can relate a lot to a cat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Do you own a cat?” He leans back in his chair, folding his arms across his lap. His sneer is gone; his gaze intent, focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t. I’ve never really considered myself responsible enough to own a pet. I wasn’t raised with animals in my home so I don’t really see it as a gap I have to fill, you know.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychiatrist nods, seemingly satisfied, and selects another inkblot from his stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How about this one?”
      </p>
      <p>
        He hands me the inkblot and I study it carefully for a few minutes, my brow furrowed in concentration and telltale beads of sweat forming at my hairline.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Is this a joke?” I didn’t like what I was seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What is it?” he inquires, “what do you see?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It looks like a coyote. Normally that wouldn’t be so bad, but it throws off the pleasant euphoria that I’d been enjoying from the previous inkblot – in a world of cat–and–mouse, I felt powerful being the cat, and related to it quite well. This coyote, it compromises the cat since it’s higher up on the food chain. A predator <em>to</em> a predator, so to speak.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying the inkblot again, I lean forward, incredulous. The inkblot looks like it’s swirling, taking on a different hue, changing. The coyote is still there, but it looks like it’s devouring something, tearing it to pieces. The cat! This doesn’t bode well with me at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look up, eyes wide open, and find the psychiatrist closer to me than I had expected him to be, a wry, almost wolfish grin on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You look surprised,” he states matter–of–factly. “What is it that you see?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “My cat. Me. I’m being eaten by what I can only see as a bigger threat to my existence, one I can’t hope to escape from. When the odds are stacked hopelessly against you, optimism is akin to futility.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Does that bother you? Does it hurt you to know that there will inevitably be obstacles in your life too big to overcome? Are you prone to <em>failure</em>?”
      </p>
      <p>
        The way he spit out that last sentence, how he emphasized the word failure, struck me as odd. It was like he was trying to instigate something, trying to badger me into snapping and saying something I didn’t necessarily mean to release. I decide to ignore the bait and continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s disconcerting, that’s for sure. It pains me to understand that as a human, as a person, I’m extremely well cut–out and adapted to just about anything that might come across my path, with the exception of some things – creatures, afflictions, cruel twists of fate. Disease, war, you name it. It doesn’t seem <em>purposeful</em> that I exist only to be struck down, however eventual that may be. I like to think that I’m here for a reason, that somewhere down the line I’m instrumental to some grander scheme that I alone am not fully capable of understanding.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychiatrist looks at me, thoughtful. “Go on.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone of his voice underscores his true sentiment: <em>that’s a nice fallacy you’ve been developing there. Now justify it.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        “All I’m saying is that life isn’t fair. No one said it had to be, but the fact remains, and I still see it as a hit below the belt. If hope is a necessary function for survival, then why were we given the intellect to question it as well?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Listen, I don’t mean to segue but I think it’s time for another inkblot to be brought into the equation.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I hesitate, momentarily unhappy that he doesn’t have an optimistic retort.
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychiatrist hands me another inkblot, lightly brushing my hand with his fingers as he lets go of the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        This one is more chaotic than the previous two had been. The inkblot is comprised of many little figures; it looks like the islands that make up an archipelago or, upon closer scrutiny, a swarm of bees.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This one looks like a swarm of bees. It’s reassuring, almost, since I can apply what I know about bees to myself and the predicament I’m in. Each of these bees has a purpose, a responsibility and obligation to the community that is always for the greater good. There’s another aspect to it as well – bees function using a hive–mind. This means that each worker bee, no matter how obscure or low in the pecking order, has a distinct purpose and serves as a benefit to the hive as a whole. The queen telepathically sends out messages to the subservient worker bees – attack, collect food, pollinate, etc – and each bee is instrumental to the community as a whole, even if on an individual level they don’t understand the bigger picture.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Kind of like you.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Precisely. What I need now is proof that I am instrumental to that greater good, and not just as a corporate shill. Holistically speaking, the bee hive makes perfect sense, but on an individual level one must still wonder – are those little worker bees frustrated with their seemingly banal, mundane existence? If they, like me, can’t even begin to comprehend the bigger picture, what makes them persevere? Is it their lack of an ability to second–guess? Trivial a question as it may be, if bees possessed an imagination, and subsequently a lust for power, would <em>coup d’etats</em> be rampant in beehives?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Grosch exhales loudly and leans back into his chair, folding his hands over his chest in a determined manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So what you’re looking for is closure, someone to tell you that everything is alright and that you’re doing a great job – waking up in the morning like a good little worker bee and going straight to the office, diligently slaving away your life for a nominal income and then tucking yourself into bed at night; depressed and alone, a pawn in a chess game that is beyond your individual comprehension. You won’t be getting any such reprieves from me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I was completely taken aback by his insolence, one step below seething rage, but was somehow able to hold my composure.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So what makes you all–mighty? Tell me, doctor, because I’m dying to know. I don’t believe in a puppet–master god who holds all the strings, an absolute authority that I can’t even hope to reckon with. I like to think that I’m in charge of my own life, and call it what you will – blind ambition, human arrogance, or even human nature – I like to think that I’m in control. I enjoy the thought, fallacy or not, that I’m the one in charge – not of others, but only myself. And I don’t want to be anybody’s pawn.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Your frustration has been noted. I’ll let the big man upstairs know, but for now, it’s time for another card.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring his sarcasm, I pick up the next inkblot and strain my eyes to make sense of the image in front of me. My first impression is that it’s of a broken world, a post–modern dystopia in which civilization has lost what little actual civility it once had. I can’t shake the feeling that it looks like a remarkably accurate representation of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I see the husks of broken buildings jutting into the air, with impromptu dirt roads traversing the rubble and debris that line this city’s streets – streets that could have once been glorious avenues or boulevards, a bleak picture of a bitter future. Skeletons of empty highways show that a civilization once prospered here, but has been lost to time. What was once a metropolis has been reduced to a de facto society, and look – you can even see squatters milling about the town square, hoping to find a bit of food, a bit of nourishment to carry them from one sullen day to the next. I see a post–apocalyptic city, where warmth is a rare and prized commodity and suffering is an ever–present companion to the denizens of this accursed place. This is as close to a hell as I’ve seen, and for what? Because boys will be boys, and wars are just the natural progression of our childhood fights with neighbors and friends?”
      </p>
      <p>
        I see a glimmer in Dr. Grosch’s eyes, and I wonder if it has always been there.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So tell me, doctor, what I <em>really</em> have to look forward to. On a long enough timeline, we’ll blow each other out of the water and it’s Cain and Abel all over again, brother against brother, and then what? This? No thanks. I can’t be part of a society that is so resolute in its own destruction. If this is the future, then count me out, I don’t want to persevere in a world that’s so blatantly headed in the direction of its own downfall.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychiatrist looks at me apathetically and pulls open one of his desk drawers, studying the contents with an almost strained silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You said that you wanted to be in charge of your own destiny, that you didn’t want a puppet–master god pulling the strings for you. Now it’s your turn to deal with the problems of ambition. You, and only you, can bring down the Tower of Babel.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He reaches into the drawer and pulls out a handgun, wordlessly sliding it across the table to me, and in the same fluid motion lifts himself out of his chair and walks past me out of his office. The door swings shut with a gentle click behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be that he’s bluffing, or it might just be another test that I’m going to fail anyway, but Grieg’s <em>In the Hall of the Mountain King</em> starts playing in my head and becomes more and more tumultuous with each passing second. Everything speeds up as the insights I’ve attained throughout my life coalesce into one beautiful, glorious epiphany and I slide the barrel of the gun into my mouth, taking a deep breath of reckless abandon and knowing full well that the oxygen harbored in my lungs will go as stale as my heartbeat. I pull the trigger, and silence comes crashing down as I leave my own mark upon this world, a beautiful red Rorschach inkblot sprayed across the white wall behind my head.

    <section id="fragment">
      <h2>((a fragment of a hallucination))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">You sit there</span> in your chair next to the desk and feel yourself slipping, falling; a drifting away so slow and certain that it’s more like a creeping, like a caterpillar slowly climbing down the stem of a leaf or an aged priest descending the steps of the old bell tower, his white-tipped fingers clutching the handrail like a tenuous safety net, the very epitome of frailty hanging on to what little is left of life.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it’s not his life he’s clutching onto, but rather his life is clutching onto his body: hanging on, not certain if letting go would mean death or a worse fate – be it the passing of sanity from those safe shores of convention, of all that he was accustomed to and what he thought his life was – or if it would mean something else entirely; if that <em>something</em> that was pulling at him so steadily and surely – was that not the very specter of Death reaching out at him from the shadows? Pulling at him with long, raking fingernails, clutching at his skin; and already the whites of his eyes are exposed and unmistakeable, and the fear, <em>the fear</em> is in him now, and he feels himself letting go, sinking, thinking <em>no, no, no! Not yet, not now!</em> But it’s too late and he’s already falling, drifting away, losing himself piece by irretrievable piece..
			</p>
			<p>
				And as you sit there in your chair watching the old priest in your mind’s eye, you realize with a feeling not unlike fear that you too are slipping away, drifting further and further away from your body towards a destination unknown. You’re up there in limbo, floating and trying to paddle; your arms and legs flailing wildly, clumsily flapping like crippled wings and not making any headway. And it’s then that you think back to that nameless old priest, that ancient of days who is drifting out there just like you are, both of you nothing but conscious motes of flotsam and jetsam in an endless sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				You grit your teeth as you see a figure approaching, but perhaps <em>figure</em> isn’t the right word, for this is little more than a shimmer in the air, an apparition, a point of singular awareness - of consciousness undoubtedly - but who, and from where?
			</p>
			<p>
				And it’s with a wry grin that you realize that it’s the old man from your dream-scape, the one who was descending the stairs so slowly and surely so as not to slip (lest he fall to his death); his broken body already sprawled at the bottom of the bell tower, his chest weakly rising and falling. His eyes are glazed over, he is a clock about to run out of time. And already the ravens and vultures are circling overhead, their piercing shrieks filling the air; their sharp, hooked beaks patient and waiting for that final breath, that signal to go ahead and drop from the air like intelligent hail; claws with cruel points eager to rend into warm flesh.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as you make your way through the stars like Ur journeying through the cosmos, the realization dawns on you that your body is like a freight train, a vessel so deeply rooted in habit and convention that it maintains its course at all costs - because the terrain off the tracks is rugged and treacherous, uncharted, insane – and you don’t particularly want to find out how far the depths of insanity go.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it’s with a certain exhilaration that you realize that your mind is free to roam, able to break free of its earthly bonds and the penitentiary of the body (that paradoxical lock-and-key), and is finally able to rid itself of that unnerving handicap of physicality and tangibility, of limited perception.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s with this final haughty thought that you leave the mainland of sanity and safety behind and dive headfirst into a sea of blissful intangibility, into the alluring depths of pure, unadulterated insanity. And it’s here that you find yourself pleasantly surprised to discover that insane wasn’t <em>insane</em>, wasn’t all strait jackets and white walls. It was deeper than that: beautiful, and full of color, not darkness; effervescent and luminous, and shimmering with the kind of color that paints the world when the sun sets in August: pastel hues with a mother-of-pearl sheen, that same explosion of color you find yourself in when looking at Petker’s paintings. It is this same kind of color that reminds you of your dreams; where the blues spill into the reds and the yellows burst into the greens, where the edges melt and slip into each other to the point where they’re edges no longer but rather abstractions, convergence points, whirlpools and eddies like the kind that form between the shallows and the depths – and not just bright colors, but rich, dark colors as well: the dark earth tones of a Bavarian forest, the rooftop cross of a Portugese church outlined against the black of the mountains and the pallid moon. The light which falls in such delicate moonbeams through a canopy of mist, painting the city as the land of the dead; it is this, these words, fragments, associations, hallucinations – these are how the waters of insanity look.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fog that encircles you thins out and turns into a mist of sorts, but only momentarily, for in front of your very eyes it turns into words, a beautiful Cyrillic script that looks like a cross between Greek and English, Hebrew and Russian. You watch it shifting and shimmering in front of you as if it was hanging in the wind, and you notice with a marked curiosity that it has a distinct texture not unlike stained glass, a pattern so sublime that you know with absolute certainty (although you don’t quite know how) that it is of divine origins.
			</p>
			<p>
				Holding your breath you lean forward, incredulous, trying to get a closer look. Is that smoke you see, streaming out from behind the letters? You cough and sputter, and the smoke has filled your lungs, but it doesn’t choke you so much as fill you with the strangest of feelings, as if you had ingested a color, as if you were able to perceive the taste of indigo and the separate, distinct, not unpleasant taste of orange, a color that compliments the previous taste of indigo much like chocolate does vanilla, and suddenly you find yourself in the ice cream parlor down the street from your parent’s home, six years old again and happier than ever; the rich, decadent taste of chocolate smeared upon your lips, and the half-finished ice cream cone in your little hand – you are smiling, you are content.
			</p>
			<p>
				And somewhere in the sky above you, a certain old man is doing the cosmic dance against a backdrop of stars, kicking his feet this way and that, doing the jitterbug waltz to the beat of a thousand tribal drums played by long-dead Aztec warriors, the finest regiment Montezuma’s armies had to offer. And as you watch him, enchanted by his deliberate movements and the way that the stars and time seem to bend and respond, you realize that he’s calling something, summoning a creature of Heaven and Earth, and without word or explanation you see the caterpillar from before floating towards you like a creature from the deep seas until it reaches you and stops directly in front of you, face-to-face.
			</p>
			<p>
				You look into its black eyes and see a darkness so profound that it looks like death, like the black of the void.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Did I die?</em> You ask the caterpillar, scared of the answer you’ll receive.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>No,</em> the caterpillar answers, <em>you just had a very vivid dream that you were once alive.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				You look around at the endless space that encompasses you, at the stars twinkling from their cold perches, and already everything is fading, changing back into that transfiguring mist, and you feel memory leaving you, pouring out of your mind-vault like a torrent. You try with all your might to remember what your face looked like, but you realize with a disturbing, sinking feeling that you can’t quite remember which one you were: the young man or the old priest, or someone else entirely.

      <h2>((the man with the gold pocket-watch))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">About twenty years</span> ago, I had been sitting on my usual bench in the Piazza de Asters with the day’s newspaper unfolded across my lap. It wasn’t that the news wasn’t interesting or filled with the usual calamities, but I just couldn’t get into it that day. My focus was elsewhere; my gaze kept wandering away from the headlines, distracted, looking for somewhere to run. A glint from across the Piazza caught my eye and I craned my neck to get a better look at it. On the other side of the Piazza de Asters, across a sea of gently rolling green hills and a row of weeping willows, sat a solitary figure on a weathered old bench much like my own. With one hand he was trying to keep the newspaper on his lap from being blown away in a sudden gust of wind – funny that there should be such harsh winds, I thought, for I felt no wind on my side of the Piazza – and with the other hand he was consulting something, perhaps a timepiece of sorts, but I couldn’t quite make it out. I narrowed my eyes and studied him over the top of my newspaper. A strange expression was painted on his face, and his jaw was set in a stubborn, determined way. In his hand he clutched a gold pocket-watch, and he studied it passionately, muttering something incomprehensible the whole time. He seemed to be entirely oblivious of the world around him, and his eyes had the lost, forlorn look of one condemned.
			</p>
			<p>
				The more I studied him, the more he seemed out of place. It was a clear day with only the slightest hints of a breeze, the kind of day you could spend peacefully sprawled out on the grasses of the Piazza, basking in the sun. Meanwhile, the man on the bench seemed to be having trouble with a rogue gust of wind: the newspaper was all but being torn out of his hands by a strong current. I looked around at the various trees and grasses of the Piazza: they swayed gently, undulating in the soft breeze, betraying no sign of the winds that plagued the man on the other bench. I looked away, trying to focus on my newspaper, but to no avail. My mind was elsewhere, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the man with the gold pocket-watch. I risked another glance at him: there he was, his brow furrowed in concentration behind the newspaper that proudly stood erect in his hands, and there was no sign of the winds that had so clearly tormented him only moments earlier. I watched the man, fascinated. There was something about him, something that kept tugging at me, begging my audience in an unfamiliar court. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				A short while later, the man shifted uncomfortably in his seat and I turned to look at him. A wind was picking up, ripping and tearing at the newspaper in his hands like a snarling dog, as if it was playing a game of tug-of-war with him. Without hesitating he reached into his coat-pocket: a curious, almost scared expression on his face as his hand scrambled about his pocket and retrieved the gold pocket-watch. In one smooth motion he pulled it out of his coat-pocket and clicked the small latch on the side. It popped open and I felt my heart drop in my chest. For a split second, the harsh winds on the other side of the Piazza stopped completely - as if the wind had paused to hiccup for a moment - and everything around the pocket-watch became momentarily distorted. It was as if the whole scene had been reduced to a beautiful reflection on the placid surface of a pond, and the pocket-watch signified the spot in which an indiscriminate pebble had broken the surface tension of the still water, sending ripples of haze coursing out across the otherwise serene Piazza; ripples that coursed out in one, two, three iterations and then faded into oblivion - or rather perfect clarity - leaving behind no trace to prove that they ever existed, nothing but the sharply defined, unwavering reality of the mundane present.
			</p>
			<p>
				My eyes were wide open, betraying my surprise. At that moment I knew with a certainty beyond words that a power far greater than my own was calling to me, had thrown up a flag for my eyes to see and my eyes alone. I knew I would have to acquire that gold pocket-watch, either by skulduggery or in good faith; I knew that every cell and fiber of my being craved it, needed it, wouldn’t sleep until I held it in my hands and tenderly gazed upon its face like a mother would her darling infant. I abruptly stood up and walked away, rolling up my newspaper. As I left the Piazza I felt myself being consumed by an irrationality far greater than the absurdity of my own erstwhile existence, and all for a foreign object I had scarcely seen. Why drop everything, why let my life grind to a halt simply because of a gold pocket-watch? It made no sense yet I was convinced in my delusions. I decided to try to stop thinking about it and go about my day.
			</p>
			<p>
				A whole week I spent trying to distract myself, every waking moment I spent trying to put the man and his timepiece out of my mind, but to no avail. I went on long, solitary walks in the forest; I spontaneously visited distant family of mine that I hadn’t seen in years and endured an excruciating dinner full of long silences and scrutinizing glares; I wrote crazed poetry that came to me seemingly out of nowhere, as if a subconscious mania pushed them to the surface of my being, rejecting them. The gods pushed and pulled at me, begging admission to the court of my mind, but I relented, trying to occupy myself with trivialities so I could shake the gold pocket-watch out of my head. Life seemed tedious and dull, and entirely lacking in the divine grandeur of the gold pocket-watch. In my dreams it would fly to me on beautiful white wings, the kind angels would have, with strong, snow-white feathers. A heavenly music seemed to emanate from it, the music of nepenthe, and in that sound the sorrows of the world fell apart and got lost.
			</p>
			<p>
				A full week after I had first seen him, I had been walking down the main thoroughfare when there he was again: the man with the gold pocket-watch! I stopped and stared with the air of one witnessing a mystical vision, and the throngs of the crowd flowed around my immobile body like the water of a creek rushing around a stubborn rock in its path. There he was, his head down and back bent, with one hand gingerly placed on his hat, as if bracing himself against a strong headwind. His eyes never wavered from a fixed point in the distance, and as he walked he seemed utterly oblivious to the world around him.
			</p>
			<p>
				This time I knew for certain that I would follow him, that every shred of my being needed that pocket-watch in my possession, and somewhere below the surface of my skin, a new void opened up. I knew I would not rest until I filled that empty space with the pocket-watch, I knew sleep would not come easily and my mind would not be my own again until I sated its desires. I set off after the man, stalking my prey and never letting him out of my sight. When he was in the market-place looking at a cantaloupe, turning it over and inspecting it from all angles, I was in the adjacent stall looking at braided necklaces, one eye on the necklaces and one eye on my quarry; when he was at the tailor’s getting measured for a suit, I was lingering about outside, deeply engrossed in an animated conversation with a constable. I followed him with the diligence of a shadow and the quiet of the grave, and I was certain that he did not know of my existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				At dusk he returned home to a nondescript apartment building in a bad part of town, which surprised me. Was he not worried about brigands and thieves? Was it not in bad sense to flaunt such an ornate gold pocket-watch in public? I decided to put the matter of right and wrong out of my mind, and let the man deal with the experience that comes with making mistakes. He would kick himself for years, that was for sure, he would regret the day he ever consulted that pocket-watch in a public full of watching eyes. At my own actions I felt no guilt, I felt no shame: I was but karma’s vessel, a third party paying off the debts that the man had accrued throughout his life; living, breathing proof that everything comes full circle.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the next few days, I abandoned all I had known, my whole day-to-day existence, in order to follow the man like a jealous shadow and find out his routines, the rhythm of his life. In doing so, I experienced a strange by-product of the whole sordid affair: I began to know the man intimately, to see the little things that when added together comprised his life as a whole. I observed that he wouldn’t drink his coffee without having something sweet to accompany it, and that he was fond of Russian literature; I saw his comings and goings at the cafes and bars he frequented and took note of how often he relieved himself; and I waited, patiently biding my time. One night I almost bumped into him on the way to the washroom in a crowded cafe, but he didn’t so much as give me a second glance. I resolved to be more careful, and promised myself that if he should ever see my face, he should see it in the act of the theft I had been working so hard to ensure. There is nothing worse than a faceless enemy, nothing more satisfying than knowing the face of the one you despise. The old crones of Guinea know how to stitch this dark wisdom into their voodoo dolls, of this I am sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				A few weeks later I returned to his dingy apartment building in the dead of night, hoping to sneak into his room while he was asleep and relieve him of his treasure. I climbed up the creaky wooden staircase on tiptoes, making sure to step closest to the corner where the floor meets the wall so as to minimize the sound of my footsteps, like a rat in the dark, or a burglar – which is exactly what I was at the moment. How strange, I thought to myself, that one day I could be an ordinary god-fearing man, and the next I could be a burglar creeping along an unfamiliar building in the dead of night, with the dark motivation of riches clouding my mind. As I approached his door, I silenced my thoughts and listened intently for a few minutes before trying the doorknob. It opened, and I poured into the darkness of his room like a snake slowly uncoiling itself and moving towards its prey. There he was, laying on the bed fully clothed – how strange, I thought, for one to go to sleep fully clothed – and then, just as I was observing his sleeping form before me, he jumped up, as if from a bad dream.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You!” he shouted, pointing his trembling finger at me. “I knew it! Why do you keep following me? I saw you at the Piazza reading a newspaper, and a week later at the market, where you startled me to the point that I left my groceries there; I saw you at the Cafe de Montparnasse and the Little Prince; I see you in the morning, at night, everywhere! What do you want from me? Why do you torment me so?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stood there in front of him, dressed all in black and looking remarkably out of place in his dilapidated room, which was really no more than a glorified broom closet, and hardly large enough for the both of us to be standing there, anyway. There he was, trembling in anger in front of me, his face an irritated red flush of a mask and the veins on his forehead openly throbbing; and here I was, standing in front of him like some petty brigand. I hesitated for a moment, uncertain of how to proceed, and then decided to do what petty brigands do best: I shouted right back at him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It’s not you I want, you fool! It’s your pocket-watch! You wave it around in front of my nose like a prize just out of reach and you expect me to sit back like a callous fool and just let it slip out of my fingers? Never!”
			</p>
			<p>
				At this retort the man’s attitude changed completely. “You want the pocket-watch?” He said, dumbfounded, and began cackling like a madman; like a hyena, deranged. He pulled a chair out, the only piece of furniture in his spartan room aside from the bed and a small wooden desk, and extended it to me. Things were taking an abrupt turn to left-field, and I didn’t quite know how to respond. I sat down, feeling oddly out of place in the tiny room.
			</p>
			<p>
				 “I have been waiting for this day,” he told me. “Years and years I’ve waited for this moment to come, and it’s haunted me from the moment I first acquired this pocket-watch - acquired it much like you will, in blood, in the dead of night. Do you know what the man who I stole this watch from told me just before I killed him? He told me of an ancient Mayan greeting that is so powerful in its duality that it also exists as a law of the universe: <em>in lak'ech ala k'in.</em> And do you know what that means? It means <em>I am another yourself</em>. It means that I am you and you are me, and this cycle goes on forever. And you know what? I recognize myself in you, the me from twenty years ago who stole this same gold pocket-watch, the me who in doing so sold my soul to the devil.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He removed the pocket-watch from his coat-pocket and held it in the air in front of me, where it swung back and forth: left and right and then left again, like a divine pendulum. I swear on all that is holy that it left shimmering traces in the air around it, shockwaves, ripples - a divine energy was contained in that gold-pocket watch, of this I am certain, and this energy took hold of me, gripping me in its clutches like a vise. I couldn’t contain myself. I sprang out of the chair and seized the man’s throat in my hands, desperately trying to crush the life out of him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Take it!” He said, laughing. “Take it and choke on it,” he murmured, as his windpipe collapsed and the sounds of his laughter were reduced to a sickening wet gurgle. He went limp and I let go of him, letting his heavy body drop to the floor like so much useless weight. My breath came in ragged, panting bursts as I stood over him with the gold pocket-watch in my hand, openly admiring it. It was like a Faberge egg, a technological marvel of perfect craftsmanship. I pressed the latch on the side and the pocket-watch sprung open with a smooth, lubricated <em>swish</em>. It was beautifully manicured and diligently reported the time. I felt the hum and whirr of numerous gears moving in perfect unison beneath the handcrafted case, and took note of the strange runes that were subtly etched into the gold. Without looking into a mirror, I could feel it reflected in my eyes, burning in my pupils with the intensity of its own light. I closed the pocket-watch and slipped it into my coat-pocket, where it nestled perfectly, as if tailor-made for it. I smiled and stepped over the dead man’s body, making sure to leave the apartment building quietly and unseen through a rear exit.
			</p>
			<p>
				 My life since that fateful night has been anything but ordinary. The pocket-watch turned out to have a stranger property to it than simply being the object of my desire, and against all odds it gained an even stronger hold on my life than the way it had initially used me, rendering me wholly expedient and useful only in bringing itself into my possession. Otherworldly winds would spontaneously manifest themselves around me, always at times of divine providence: it was as if the pocket-watch was alerting me to hiccups in fate, moments of <em>deja vu</em>, hints of paradoxical importance. Everywhere I went, conditions seemed to favor the watch, and in a very curious manner indeed: instead of it simply reporting time, it seemed to change the events and circumstances around it to match its own internal logic; instead of simply keeping track of the passage of time and dutifully reporting it, the gold pocket-watch appeared to be the crux on which events unfolded and situations blossomed. I no longer took note of other human beings. I spent my days as if in a trance, speaking with others only by virtue of necessity, as if they were mere automatons, ghosts of the human shells they once occupied. I was no longer able to register emotion in the face of another. Children could be screaming next to me and I wouldn’t notice. It was as if the gold pocket-watch rendered me invisible to the world - oblivious to the world - because I carried the world with me wherever I went. It was as if it wasn’t simply a timepiece, but rather the fountain of existence that time streams out of, the very center of the universe that generates the cosmos and the never-ending fabric of space and time. It was the catalyst to the initial event spoken of in chaos theory. It was, and will always be, the center of the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				But why am I telling you this depressing story that has provided naught but bad fortune for me? As I sit here, reading the day’s newspaper on my familiar bench in the Piazza de Asters, a sudden gust of wind tears at the newspaper in my hand and I have to clutch at it with both hands to keep it from flying away. As I flatten the wrinkles out of the paper on my lap, I see a man sitting on an adjacent bench across the square. He has a newspaper spread out in front of his face, shielding it from view, but he doesn’t seem to be very engrossed in it. Twice already I’ve caught him making furtive glances in my direction, each instance exactly as I consulted the pocket-watch for the time. Who is this man, with his determined expression and shifty eyes? He looks just like a man I saw a few days ago making his way near the old bus station with his collar propped up against the wind, the brim of his hat sitting low over his eyes, that same determined expression painted across his face. I feel my concentration ebbing away from the newspaper and my mind whirring into overdrive. That couldn’t have been the same man that I had bumped into last night as I was leaving The Parisian, could it? I glance around the Piazza, suddenly feeling like prey being stalked - a very unsettling feeling. As if realizing my distress, the man across the square abruptly stands up and begins walking away, slowly rolling up his newspaper. I watch his form as it retreats, and realize, with a sinking feeling that reeks of fear, that this is the same man who is going to kill me. I harbor no ill will towards this man, no more than I do against myself. All I know is that when I meet him face-to-face - and the time will inevitably come - I will approach him with a simple greeting: <em>in lak'ech ala k'in.</em>

				<span class="open-quote">Dear Diary,</span><br><br>
				I found an unopened letter today. I had been walking to the coffee shop when I noticed it flapping in the wind, trapped against the curb as if it was left there just for me. I looked around, once, twice, just to make sure no one was looking, and then I picked it up, turning it over in my hands and searching for clues. It was a small envelope, the kind that you would expect to come with a Christmas gift or a bouquet of flowers. It wasn’t addressed to anyone, just sealed and nondescript. I decided to open it. A letter fell out, neatly folded with a picture on one side and writing on the other. The picture was a black and white illustration of a depressed-looking young man sitting at the edge of a dock, with a fishing line cast into the dark water below him. He didn’t look very hopeful. Far below the water, and unbeknownst to the young man, the fishing hook was caught in the hem of a young woman’s shirt. She lay on the ocean floor surrounded by corals and anemones, her long hair and regal skirt flowing with the waves. She looked so serene, so content as she lay there on the sea bed, and neither one knew the other existed. I turned the page over. The handwriting was beautiful, almost calligraphic in form and dark black like onyx. The first sentence said, <em>don’t ever hold yourself responsible for my actions.</em> Intrigued, I decided to keep reading. The second said, <em>it’s just that I’ve missed you so much…</em> It looked like it was written for a past lover, the prose implying that it was definitely not for relatives or a simple friend. It was an apology of sorts, a notice of departure; but for where, and to what end? I kept reading. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The second paragraph was more telling. It began:
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>It takes a certain kind of courage to take those first few steps out onto the plank. To stand over the dark and churning waters of the unknown and to brace yourself for the icy-cold rush of the abyss, like a giant black hole trying to swallow you whole. To really believe that in every end there’s a new beginning, beautiful and novel and virgin-white.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I hesitated. I was reading something intensely personal, a confession that was a lifetime in the making. Curiosity overpowered guilt and I continued, the futile screams of my erstwhile conscience falling upon deaf ears. Somehow I knew that I would pay dearly for this, that sleep would not come so easily anymore and that I would spend long nights alone, pondering the suffering and torment of another, bearing the weight of being the sole witness to their pain.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>We don’t all progress at the same rate, it said, some of us are faster, some slower, and some don’t belong here at all. I, to my chagrin, am of the latter category. My life so far has been that of a fish out of water. The entirety of my existence has been a prolonged suffering, a perpetual sigh of discontent. I am not indelible. As Camus once said, “there is only one truly serious philosophical question, and that is suicide. Deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy. All other questions follow from that.” Camus, genius that he was, managed to persevere until the age of 46 when he was killed in a car accident alongside a close friend – 46! - I call this thinly-veiled serendipity, for every suicide knows that it is much better to be killed at the hand of another than to die by your own hand. Ten years after his death, a previously unpublished work of his was posthumously released. Ironically enough, the title he chose for it was A Happy Death. I, however, have not resigned myself to waiting for death cowering and unawares. There is a solemn dignity in suicide, a dignity that the Japanese Samurai of yesteryear relished and reverently called seppuku: the art of dying with honor.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I realized that I was clutching the letter with trembling hands. My palms were sweaty, and the hair on my arms was standing on end, like little brown palm trees sticking out of sand-dune goosebumps. I gulped loudly, and looked around again. No one was watching. It was like I tuned out the world; I hadn’t even been paying the slightest attention to what was going on around me. I felt foolish, standing out there in the bright, warm sunlight of a beautiful spring day, reading of someone’s heartbreak and despair. <em>They must have felt so cold while writing this,</em> I thought. <em>So cold, and so, so alone.</em> I didn’t know the person, or if it was even written by a male or female, but I felt for them. Empathy is one of the stronger emotions we’re subject to as humans, and I felt like I had been laid out, prostrated by its sheer power. Maybe it’s because we all want to be martyrs, but I felt like throwing myself in front of the train, taking a bullet for this person, or at the very least embracing them and whispering <em>everything’s going to be alright, just you wait and see.</em> The helplessness I felt was overwhelming, and as I’m sure most recipients of such notes feel, I felt completely and utterly useless. I was an afterthought, a brief notation on the bottom of the page in a history book that wasn’t relevant anymore. Their life was over. The case was closed. There was nothing to do but wait and reflect. Inconsolable in my grief, I continued reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Years and years I stood on that plank, watching, wondering what it would be like. I wondered if it was right to embark on such a quest when I knew how much it would hurt my family and friends. After much deliberation and many a sleepless night, I came to the conclusion that this was the only choice I had. I spent a lifetime living in a world lighter than air, a world where I was, unfortunately, the air. The simple truth was that I had had enough. I didn’t want to be at the forefront, or the background, or at all. I felt like a child who had spontaneously been given a gift. It was beautiful at first: an act of love, yes, but it came with its own set of responsibilities, which in turn became burdens, and every once in a while I couldn’t help but wonder if it was worth all the trouble. I couldn’t give it back – that would be entirely unacceptable. No, I had to put it somewhere, to stash it in a place where it wouldn’t easily be found. It wasn’t how I was brought up, or the way I’d spent my time, because the fact of the matter was that I loved living, and I didn’t think it would simply end at death. I had always felt like an outsider, like a traveler who has returned home after years of exploring fascinating and exotic places, only to find home as a familiar map filled with strange faces and even stranger customs. I knew the place intimately, and every corner held a story from my childhood, but it wasn’t mine, and I wasn’t the same person. I was an actor in an unfamiliar play, and the problem wasn’t that I didn’t remember my lines - I did remember my lines, I had simply been miscast. The people looked like me, yet we were not the same. I felt as if I had an invisible barrier around me, barring me from fully immersing myself in society, and I sat behind it like a sullen king, impervious to the horrors of the world. I saw evil, and I took note of it, but it did not change me. I saw happiness, undoubtedly, but the heart-warming aspect of it was lost, diffused against my impenetrable facade…</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Something fluffy and moist attacked my leg, and I kicked it out of instinct. It yelped, and a woman yelled at me for kicking her dog. I apologized and told her that it had startled me, and accusingly asked her what was she doing creeping around here anyway? I felt like I was losing touch with the world, like the more I read of the letter the more of my sanity I was losing. I hadn’t even heard the woman or her dog approach me. She muttered something about red eyes and smoking, and I briefly considered telling her exactly how I felt: that they were tears, real ones, and that there were larger matters at hand than her stupid chihuahua. I thought better of it. The whole situation made me empathize with the author more, because he was right, people do overstep their lines and don’t even feel guilty about it, and those of us who don’t want to hurt others but simply ourselves can’t because of some age-old dogma about suicide being a sin. Maybe the world <em>would</em> be better off without us. It was an uncharacteristic thought, and I made a mental note to not get sucked into the same maelstrom as the unfortunate author of the letter, but it reverberated and rang true. The Earth would look so <em>different</em> without people! So much more natural and pure, and even the rape of Nanking was nothing compared to the rape of Earth by her parasitic humans. I walked further down the road, in the opposite direction of the scolding woman, until I reached a quiet spot in the shade beneath an oak tree. The letter was the most interesting thing I’d ever read, and I hungered for it, wanting more like some junkie desperately waiting for the next fix. Anything tempered by the loss of a human life is worth infinitely more, and it would be no small tragedy if it went overlooked.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>…for even as I met you, and we got to know each other, I always had one foot on the other side, one foot in those dark, lapping waters. Just know that I held on for you, for it was you who showed me the beauty of a new day and the promise of tomorrow. It was you who took me by the hand and told me that everything works out, you just have to wait for it and help it along sometimes. I’m sorry I only heeded your advice halfheartedly, and I hope you can use it as consolation for yourself in my absence. The truth is that I’ve always loved you, much more than I have ever loved myself. You were the spark that kept me going, the unshakeable little voice that should have been my own, but wasn’t. What a different day tomorrow would be if that was my own voice urging me along this uphill battle, what a different world it would be…</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I couldn’t help it. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, and I didn’t care who saw me sob and moan, I didn’t care about the people driving by who were undoubtedly pointing and wondering; all I cared about was making sure that my tears didn’t fall directly onto the handwriting, onto the last will and testament of this person’s existence, with its beautiful flourishes and swirls. My nose was running and I looked like a wreck. I sat down on the cold dirt, wiping my nose on the back of my hand and leaning against the tree trunk, my body gently trembling, my mind one big churning whirlpool of agony. Were there not enough flourishes and swirls in your life to keep you going? I don’t think I had known true pain until that moment, and it hurt so much more because it wasn’t even physical pain, it was a mental anguish that cut straight through to the heart, as if there was no skin or muscle or bone over it to protect it. I steadied myself, taking deep, numbered breaths and waited until my heart rate stopped red-lining and slowed to a normal beat. I exhaled, bracing myself, and continued reading.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>…it’s time I let go, darling, for the hour is quickly approaching. It’s time I jumped into the water and swam in a sea of blissful intangibility, finally free of my terrestrial bonds. I’ll be like Ur drifting through the cosmos, experiencing firsthand the esoteric mechanics of death and the divine beauty of metamorphosis. Life is too corporeal, too trite an endeavor to needlessly perpetuate, and I find myself out of patience and out of chances. Let those who seek know that this is my pursuit of happiness in action, the fates be damned. There could be ten hells worse than this one, but I’ll take my chances.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				It was signed with a resolute <em>– S.D.</em> The futility of my situation angered me beyond words, and I clutched my hair. I wanted to scream. Even the hyphen seemed to imply, mathematically speaking, that you were removing yourself from the equation of life. Who were you, S.D., that you suffered so? Had I known I would have thrown you a life preserver, something, anything, to prevent you from diving into those illusory depths! You will haunt me my whole life, you who couldn’t keep up with the world and its indiscriminate, breakneck pace. And even now I find myself pacing the halls, trying to busy myself, trying to keep myself from being sucked into your contagious misery. You beautiful, tortured stranger. How I feel for you, how I regret your loss.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet I find myself on a quest not unlike yours, for it is my responsibility now, my burden to locate your past love and ensure that your letter reaches the right hands. It would be no small tragedy if your anguished words were to fall upon deaf ears, and it is up to me to ensure that they do not. Know that in forfeiting your life, you have given my own some small measure of purpose, an additional meaning, and for that I will be forever grateful. Consider myself indebted to your shade, O brave explorer, and may you find whatever it is you were searching for.

      <h2>((the man who looked like einstein))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">It was a dark and stormy night</span> on the picturesque Moroccan shore of Tangiers, where the only thing separating the cold waters of the Atlantic from the warm, idyllic waters of the Mediterranean was Cape Spartel; and there, just past the Cape, lay the famed Straight of Gibraltar, like a giant transatlantic turnstile. It was a night where the waves rose back, yawning as tall as apartment buildings and swallowing all the sound in their dark, gaping maws before crashing down with the force and intensity of tribal war drums. Bolts of lightning tore across the sky, illuminating the landscape below in all its distress: trees leaning, almost kissing the ground from the high winds; barricaded windows and closed shutters were visible across all the buildings and homes, like so many anthills trying to wait out the storm. Peals of thunder reverberated across the rocky shoreline, calamitous and entirely inconsequential to the story at hand, since this story takes place not on a coastal city in the grips of a thunderstorm, but rather in the apathetic streets of Los Angeles: drab and gray and drenched in the characteristically warm glow of a typically Southern California day, where the air is thick like the humid climate of a tropical island in the Caribbean, but entirely lacking in all the glorious amenities of such an island paradise.. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I had been walking down the street, coughing and trying not to breathe as I walked through the acrid black cloud of smoke left behind by a passing bus, when something caught my eye. It was a man across the street and a bit of a ways down, bent over next to a bus bench, hastily tying his shoes. The wall of the furniture store behind him looked more like a fresco of contemporary graffiti art rather than the simple wall advertisement it actually was, and as I watched, he stood up and retrieved an old, beat-up leather briefcase from the bus bench and set off at a brisk pace down the street. I recognized him immediately and watched, spellbound, as he receded into the distance. <em>That man looks just like Einstein,</em> I thought to myself. That bushy, silver-gray hair jumped out at me from a hundred textbook pictures, tugged at my memory from prize-winning speeches and lectures; that signature, resolute hint of a smile at the corners of his wrinkled face; that effortless air of self-confidence that only the truly genius possess and exude.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>There goes the greatest physicist of our time,</em> I thought to myself. The coattails of his gray tweed blazer trailed behind him as he broke into a run while trying to board a passing bus, getting smaller and smaller until he was no more than a tiny point in the horizon, a lone dot slapping his briefcase on the side of the bus in frustration. I couldn’t help but think of parallax and its ramifications; I couldn’t help but think that all I wanted to do was chase him, to beg him for a bit of sage wisdom or to sit and practice metaphysics with one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century, but alas, he was gone, as elusive as the Higgs-Boson; and even though I now knew he was out there, I was going to have to spend my whole life trying to find him.
			</p>
			<p>
				For weeks I couldn’t stop thinking about him, couldn’t get that optimistic old German immigrant out of my thoughts. I would walk around aimlessly for days trying to put myself in the path of chance, tempting fate or destiny or whatever powers that be to grant me just one more meeting with my muse, my Einstein. They say that the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was proving to the world that he exists, but I know of a better trick, a trick so genius that everyone still believes in it unfailingly and without question, a truth so logical in hindsight that it was a wonder we all missed it. And it made perfect sense to me, as crazy as it sounds, and I followed this newfound truth tirelessly, hoping to forge a friendship with the man we all unflaggingly considered to be long dead: Einstein. I wanted to approach him with a knowing smile and whisper into his ear <em>It’s OK, Albert. Your secret is safe with me,</em> give him a firm handshake and invite him over to my apartment for some tea and eclairs, and a long, dialectical chat. But to my distress, a month passed and I had not run into him again.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began to think that perhaps the city was getting to me, this dirty city with its crime and pollution, its inhabitants who pass by the same faces every day on their walk to work but still decline to say hello. I was about to board the bus one day, deep in my thoughts, when I caught sight of a familiar figure approaching me in the distance. I watched wide-eyed as the man neared me, the swagger in his walk a testament to his genius, and I immediately strode over to meet him.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Hello there,” I said nonchalantly, “beautiful day, isn’t it?”
			</p>
			<p>
				His pace slowed down just a bit, and he studied me with cautiously narrowed eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“It is,” he replied in a completely normal, typically West-coast American accent, an accent that was more the lack of an accent than an accent in itself. <em>He’s good,</em> I thought to myself. Not only had he removed all the traces of his native accent from his speech, but even the petulant expression on his face seemed to suggest that he wasn’t the great German physicist I knew him to be. I continued, undeterred.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” I said, putting my arm around his shoulders like an old friend and giving him a slight nudge to begin walking down the street. “Your secret is safe with me.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stopped walking for a moment and peered around cautiously before turning back to whisper in his ear. “I’m a fan,” I said, giving him a conspiratorial wink and a reassuring smile.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of his eyebrows rose sharply and I couldn’t help but be impressed. <em>He’s really done his homework,</em> I thought. But of course he did – the man was not only a genius, he was <em>the</em> genius!
			</p>
			<p>
				He peered out of those small eye sockets at me, his face a mask of incredulity and perhaps a hint of dissimulated annoyance.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Are you on drugs?” He asked, looking me straight in the eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“No,” I replied, beaming. “But if I was, I’d <em>really</em> want to talk to you.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He didn’t seem to understand the compliment in my words, and immediately took a step back.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Look,” he said, putting both hands before him like a mime tracing the outline of his invisible cage, “I don’t know how to say this, but I’m not who you think I am. I feel absolutely silly saying this, but.. I’m not Einstein, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“What’s your name?” I asked, demonstrating that I was willing to play along. “What do you go by now?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I go by my actual name,” he said, grumpily. “And my name isn’t Albert Einstein.” He glanced at his watch.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen, sir, I have to go,” he said, exhaling impatiently. “This has already gone on for too long.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He turned to leave and I put a tentative hand on his shoulder.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Before you go,” I said, “please, just a bit of wisdom? Just a little something I could think about for the next few weeks, maybe what you were thinking about when you woke up this morning, or some keen observation about the world that’s been on your mind lately?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don’t think you understand,” he said, exasperated. “If you must know, I’m simply an actor who <em>plays</em> Albert Einstein in B-list movies and under-financed documentaries about his life. I’m not <em>actually</em> Einstein. Do you get it?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded slowly, a big, shit-eating grin on my face.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s genius,” I said, nodding and beaming. “I’m amazed I didn’t think of that before – you’ve convinced the world that you died, but also found a way to stop aging – so no one thinks you’re Einstein because Einstein is, of course, dead. But he’s not. You’re him. And it’s even more genius to think that you were able to peer so far into the future; that you were so prescient as to know that your celebrity is one that would be celebrated for decades – centuries, even – and knew that with the advent of film you would have a career doing the seemingly impossible – playing yourself in movies and interviews for the rest of your indefinite life, making sure your legacy is protected; for we all know that biography is the greatest fear of celebrities, and rightfully so – brutes, those biographers, careless brutes! And the most amazing thing to me is not that you’re the only one to do this, but that you do it right under our noses, and operate with absolute impunity. You’ve truly earned your reputation.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				He narrowed those dark eyes at me, those wise, knowing eyes that peered out at me from posters and textbooks my whole life, those eyes that inspired and changed the face of the world.
			</p>
			<p>
				“A beautiful theory, but I’m afraid it’s entirely specious.” He said, throwing his arms up in frustration.
			</p>
			<p>	
				“And listen, I really must be going. The only reason I look like this right now is because I’m going to yet another audition. The life of a genius, you know, struggling and not even owning a car, running from one audition to the next and struggling, always struggling, to make ends meet. Relying on the poorly organized cesspool that is public transportation in Los Angeles. Truly genius. Anyway, I’m going to be late. Good-bye.”
			</p>
			<p>
				And just like that, he was off. Now that I knew the area in which I assumed he lived, I was going to frequent it more often in the hopes of running into him again. I’m not so easily fooled as to take what he said on good faith. I had done my homework and was going to meet my idol, for how many chances do you get to meet someone you worship and respect and had previously thought to be dead?
			</p>
			<p>
				Two weeks later I was at a sidewalk cafe surreptitiously reading a newspaper when I saw him approaching. I immediately set the newspaper down and rose to meet him just as he was about to walk past me.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Hello there,” he said, greeting me cautiously. He knew the ball was in my court.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Say,” I said, wasting no time and getting to the heart of the matter. “Have you ever thought about extraterrestrial life? Do you think something is out there, waiting to be discovered?”
			</p>
			<p>
				His eyebrows angled down sharply in the middle, pointing toward his nose like the two arms at the bottom of a pinball machine. He began muttering something but hesitated and, thinking better of it, turned to look me full-on in the eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How about this?” He said, taking a deep breath. “Our scientists take remote-operated submersibles down into the deepest recesses of the ocean and bring life up from the depths. Life that has never before encountered light from our sun. Life that has never known of any existence other than the depths – and the depths, just so you know, are almost no different from deep space – it’s a very similar kind of environment. So say one of these human scientists dredges up a new species of octopus from the dark abyss below the waves, a creature that we all know to be extremely intelligent and entirely conscious of its surroundings. So we bring it up to the surface, and it feels less and less pressure on it as it makes its way up, kind of like what we humans would experience if you took one of us further away from the Earth, outside of the scope of gravity: a lack of weight, freedom of movement and less resistance from our surroundings, albeit infinitely more pressure in our situation. So we bring this poor creature up so we can observe it: perhaps we put it into a specially-made aquarium if it survives the journey to the surface, or we dissect it if it happens to have died on the way up. Its anger, fears, comfort or frustration are not necessarily taken into account. And what does this creature know about life outside of water; what does this poor, intelligent octopus understand about a world <em>above</em> water, or of the humans that so painstakingly and deliberately brought it to the surface?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Einstein paused for a moment, looking at me as if waiting for me to meet him in the middle. My silence beckoned him to continue.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Absolutely nothing. In a very similar way, it makes perfect sense that a form of intelligent life is out there, a form of life that evolved parallel to our own but in an entirely different arena, unbeknownst to ourselves. So where am I going with all this? It is not stupid to consider such alternate forms of life, but rather it is <em>foolish</em> to attempt to consider such possibilities when we so clearly have a dearth of information. It is akin to conspiracy theorists fear-mongering about the Illuminati when they are on the absolutely bottom rung of the pecking order of the powers that be. It is an exercise in futility, no more and no less.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He stood up straighter for a moment, and folded his arms across his slightly-puffed out chest. His eyes were at half-mast; the familiar countenance of the philosopher-saint I so greatly admired. An errant tear worked its way down my cheek, and brought my muse back to reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s what I think, anyway.” He added quietly, realizing that he had played directly into my suspicions.
			</p>
			<p>
				I stared at him in awe, scrutinizing the wrinkles in his noble face like an old crone reading tea leaves, satisfied with the way they settled. I extended my trembling hand and he shook it, looking me directly in the eye with a studious, curious expression.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Thank you,” I said, and for the first time, I turned and walked away.
			</p>
			<p>
 				The walk back home to my apartment was a half-remembered blur, my mind abuzz with a new perspective, a new way of looking at things. That noble genius trusted me enough to bestow some real information on me, capital-T truth that I never could have hoped for in a million years. <em>What a world,</em> I thought to myself, <em>where a long-dead genius removes the cloak of his assumed identity and takes me beneath the wing of his gray tweed blazer; all to help me understand the universe a bit more clearly.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				A month passed, and then another as I tirelessly contemplated the universe from my new perspective. It was like Einstein had given me rocket fuel, the perfect metaphysical fodder to aid me in my quest to understand the world I lived in, and it was a productive few months as the papers grew in taller and taller stacks on my desk, growing not unlike clusters of mushrooms, leaning at the top and sagging this way and that.
			</p>
			<p>
				One morning I awoke after a night of intense dreams where I felt like I had been abducted and put into a very small, sterile white room. It had a single window on one of the walls, a circular thing made of slightly convex glass that gave it the impression of a porthole. I stayed in that room for what seemed like an eternity, hurling myself at the walls like a lunatic in an insane asylum, for hours on end. At one point I lay prostrated on the cold floor, and for some reason I felt like I was being watched. I turned around slowly and looked over my shoulder toward the window, only to find my gaze met by a big, strange eye. I don’t quite know how to describe it aside that it reminded me of one of those googly-eyes that you can pick up from an arts and crafts store, the kind of eye that children paste onto construction paper. Two things were immediately apparent: one, that it was not a human eye; and two, that there was a definite intelligence in that eye, a cold, calculating intelligence that didn’t quite give a damn about my feelings or fears or frustrations. I woke up screaming, tangled and sweating in my covers.
			</p>
			<p>
				I went down to Einstein’s neighborhood that day, hoping to run into him, hoping he could deliver me from the visions he had instilled in my mind.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Einstein!” I exclaimed, happy to have found him. “I need your help! I need more of your sage wisdom, more of your advice..”
			</p>
			<p>
				He didn’t let me finish, he just made an impatient gesture with his hand and told me he was in a hurry.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But you don’t understand,” I said, tripping and falling over my words as I stumbled over an uneven square in the sidewalk.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m in danger! I feel like I need to know more, that what you told me was a dangerous kind of knowledge and that now I need to balance it out with more knowledge, another hint as to the puzzle of existence. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m going crazy and am in desperate need of help.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I absentmindedly gripped a clump of my hair in my hands, distressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” he said, placing a gentle hand on my shoulder. “You have an overactive imagination. That’s all. You don’t need any more ‘sage wisdom’ or anything else from me – you just need to calm down, and probably find a hobby or something. Now I need to go, I’m already late and I can’t afford to keep talking to you.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He began to walk away but I jumped on him, forcefully holding him back. He turned to me, his face a mask of anger, his eyes as small as slits and shooting fire in my direction.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You want help?” He said mockingly. “You’re in danger? Then tie your fucking shoes. That’s the only danger you’re in.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He huffed and wrenched his shoulder out of my grasp and began hurriedly walking down the street. I watched him go as I felt the lump in my throat growing and the tears about to break loose behind the floodgates.
			</p>
			<p>
				“And one more thing,” he said, calling out over his shoulder. “I’m not Einstein!”
			</p>
			<p>
				He rounded the corner, out of sight. Reality hit me like a brick wall and I looked down at the dirty gray concrete of the sidewalk, at the strange pattern of chewing gum that had been spit out in past decades, and at my unlaced shoes. My eyes grew wide as I understood what he had told me; that prescient, noble saint! Only a genius could have spotted what was directly beneath our noses; only a genius is capable of noticing that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes and calls him on it. Tears spurred out of sadness turned into tears of happiness and I whooped with joy, bending over to lace my shoes before running down the block to where Einstein had rounded the corner. I stood there, my hand over my eyes, looking for a sign of my eccentric muse. I saw a figure running off in the distance, an old leather briefcase tucked under one arm and a familiar bounce in his bushy, silver-black hair as he took long strides. I was amazed that a man of his age could run that fast, but then, remembering that he had somehow cheated the process of aging and death, my surprise dissipated.
			</p>
			<p>
				The last time I spoke with him he had been waiting behind a bus bench, pacing up and down and looking around nervously. I knew it was me he was watching out for; I knew that to him I was a pest, a testament of the legacy he left behind, yet it was the same legacy he still paradoxically inhabited and made a living off of.
			</p>
			<p>
				I approached him with my hands up and palms out, as if to show him that I didn’t mean to do him any harm.
			</p>	
			<p>
				“Guten morgen, Herr Einstein,” I said, hoping to establish some rapport and wondering if I was pronouncing the German properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				“God damnit,” he muttered, looking me up and down. “What do you want? What is it now? Have you put your underwear on inside-out?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“No,” I replied, ignoring his quip. “I just came to tell you that I won’t bother you anymore. This will be the last time, I promise, and I just want to know one more thing.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He rolled his eyes, which surprised me. Just imagine, a man of his age and reputation, rolling his eyes!
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fine,” He said, grudgingly. “What is it? What can I do for you, O noble lunatic? What deep mysteries of life and the cosmos would you like to know now?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Ignoring his sarcasm, I gave him my plea.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” I began, searching for the right words. “I want you to tell me what the smartest thing you’ve ever done in your life was. Now it doesn’t have to be in your Einstein-specific life, it could be from your post-Einstein’s-death-life, if that makes any sense. It could be anything. So please tell me what it was, and take all the time in the world to think about it, and I promise I won’t pester you again. OK?”
			</p>
			<p>
				Einstein didn’t say a word, he just stood across from me with eyes like the narrowed slits of a medieval war helmet and slowly nodded his head.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You want to know what the smartest thing I’ve ever done in my life was?” He asked.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Yes,” I said, holding my breath.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fine.” He replied, peeved. “If you must know, what I’m going to tell you isn’t something I did, but rather something I <em>would</em> do, should I be given the opportunity to do it again, which I suspect I shall. What I’m going to tell you about is one of those irritating moments in life where you understand what you should have done just seconds or minutes after the opportunity has passed. In my case, it occurred in the very earliest moments of my life, and is what I have since recognized as my first regret. For the same reason we can know everything about the universe from simply studying the first few moments after the Big Bang, we can directly understand the rest of the course of our lives from actions that were made initially. Are you following me?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded meekly, spellbound.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I came to with no recollection of how I got there, no recollection at all. It was the first few moments after I came into existence, and, in the custom of the Viennese doctors who birthed me, I was taken to an observation room right next to the birthing room. This room was a tiny white room, more like a cabinet at shoulder height than a room, and heated to a lovely degree, although the floor was cold – I remember that part distinctly. Why the floor was cold, or why they even placed me on the floor, I have no idea – medical science has come quite far since those days, thanks in large part to Semmelweis’ contributions. Anyway, I was your typical baby: screaming and squalling and trying to make sense of the world, when all of a sudden I got a very distinct, unsettling feeling – a feeling I wasn’t used to then but am quite used to now: the feeling of being watched.”
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point he stopped for a moment to stare daggers at me, and I felt slightly uncomfortable for stalking him like some animal. I gulped loudly and he continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I wasn’t aware at the time that the unsettling feeling I was experiencing was an instinctual response to a potential predator left over from countless years of evolution, and so I turned out of pure instinct and looked over my shoulder to where a large, circular glass window was. I think it was the only one in the room. The glass was slightly convex, and so it lent a magnifying effect to anything that was on the other side of it, which, in my case, turned out to be one of the doctors. I saw a big, strange eye peering out at me, an eye which I couldn’t yet recognize as human, only extremely intelligent and somewhat foreboding. It was when this doctor opened the door and wrapped my naked body in a soft blanket that I realized that the moment had passed, and my opportunity had disappeared. I was handed into my mother’s arms, and we were both crying, but for entirely different reasons. For her, the life that stretched out before me was opportunity that she bequeathed me, ripe and full of potential; but as for me, all my opportunity lay behind me, lost in those first few minutes of existence. And here I am, standing before you as an old man who is still angry that he did not pick up the reins and change the course of his life.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“I don’t understand,” I said. “So you mean to say that you’re going to try this again in your next life, should you be born again and find yourself in the same situation?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Precisely,” he said impatiently, dismissing my naive question with a flamboyant wave of the hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What I’m going to do is very simple, should I find myself in that position once more. When I get born again – and like I mentioned earlier, I suspect I will – I’m going to pop out of my mother’s womb, wait for the doctors to sever my umbilical cord – and the reason for this is quite straightforward: if I was born with teeth I would simply bite it off and save the time, but no matter. The doctors would take care of the umbilical cord anyway, so why bother? Then I would yank the scissors used to sever my umbilical cord out of the doctor’s hands, jump up and stab him in the eye with them, then make my way over to my father and punch him directly in the jewels to make sure he wouldn’t be able to screw me like that again..”
			</p>
			<p>
				I watched in mute disbelief as Einstein gesticulated wildly and made all sorts of pounding, punching gestures, including stomping the ground repeatedly with one foot, as if he was fighting a number of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				“And if all goes according to plan, the hospital staff would recognize me as a demon and either lock me away or kill me. And I would never have to be born again. I would never have to suffer this, this hopeless, miserable ennui. Do you understand? And that’s the smartest thing I would have done, and that’s the best advice I can ever give you should you find yourself in that situation again.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I nodded, never taking my eyes off of him, this genius who thinks on a completely different scale than common man. I put my hands in my pockets and slowly backed away, my eyes still glued to his face. <em>Genius reaches the greatest of heights and the lowest of lows,</em> I thought to myself, and I felt scared, not just for myself, but for him. Once I was a few feet away I took my hands out of my pockets and turned around, breaking into an all-out run.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Everything’s relative!” He called out after me, cackling like a madman.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Isn’t that what you wanted to hear? Everything’s relative, you motherfucker, and your shoelaces are still untied!”
			</p>
			<p>
				My foot stepped on a loose shoelace from my other foot and I was pitched forward, mid-stride and at full speed. And in the eternity between my head hitting the cold gray concrete and everything fading to black, I thought to myself <em>He’s right, that genius. He’s always right.</em>

    <section id="scream">
      <h2>((the scream))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">The subway rocked gently</span> as it left Queens and headed off in the direction of Manhattan. All the seats were taken, and the aisles were crowded with human flotsam and jetsam: the elderly clutching their rolling backpacks, single mothers with children in tow, teenagers unselfconsciously gossiping with loud rock music blasting from headphones hanging around their necks. I sat in my seat quietly, taking everything in with a curious eye and subconsciously eavesdropping. I looked out of the window at the romantic old buildings that lined New York’s crowded streets, beautiful facades from the previous century that once sported a spotless gray luster but had been blackened by decades of pollution from a living city. I looked at the years of grime painted across those silent buildings, and at the graffiti that seemed to sprout up around the bases like a burgeoning fungus, an urban mold that was testament to the unbreakable will of man. And I had the strangest thought while looking out of those windows: <em>nothing seemed to make sense anymore.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				The people, the signs, the storefronts – for what? I felt my heartbeat quicken and I breathed nervously, suddenly anxious with a yearning I couldn’t quite describe. From the raised tracks I saw people milling about below me, getting jostled and bumping into one another on the city streets, nothing more than ants in a glorified ant farm. And I couldn’t help but wonder what they were doing here, what I was doing here. Life suddenly seemed so trivial, so banal. I looked at the billboards, at the street signs, at the policemen in their silly blue uniforms. They were all directing us where to go, what to like, what to do. Buy this. Do that. Red means stop, green means go. And it seemed so silly, seeing all those people, seemingly autonomous creatures of free will, each with their own agenda and their own life, all going nowhere. All with something to do, but all of it ultimately meaning nothing in the end.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began to panic. The subway lurched to a stop and I got off in lower Manhattan. I thrust my hands in my pockets and set off at a quick pace down the city’s labyrinthine streets. The people of the city stopped and stared at me with apprehensive eyes, as if sensing a cancer in their midst. I stopped to tie my shoes and people kept bumping into me, almost knocking me off of my feet. Everyone was rushing somewhere, yet I knew they had nowhere to go. I wanted to stop everyone, to shake them and scream <em>but where are you really going?</em> Words and symbols were everywhere: emblazoned on clothing, painted across buildings, and deeply ingrained into everything around me; all for naught. What did all of this mean, all these uniforms and signs and Wall Street executives running around like so many scared penguins? What did we, as a people, mean? None of our dramas and friendships and science actually means anything in the end, and I couldn’t help but think of a time when I was younger, much younger than today, when a friend of mine told me about one of his most cherished memories with his father.
			</p>
			<p>
				When he was just a little boy, my friend explained to me, he would wait until it rained so he could have outings with his father. He and his father would don rain jackets and big rubber boots and go outside to stomp on helpless snails. They would wait until dusk, when all the snails would come out, lured by the rain, and they would run about gaily and laugh and stomp every snail they could find with a satisfying <em>crunch.</em> He would pray for rain, this friend of mine, so that he and his father could bond over the massacre of hundreds of snails in under an hour. I remember him telling me that story plain as day, without a guilty conscience or anything of the like; only the warm glow of reminiscing about a fond memory decorating his face. I remember being horrified; that sick, wretched feeling of <em>but that’s so wrong</em> deep in my gut, and feeling so sick I almost threw up. This friend, he didn’t understand my reaction at all. He didn’t see it as anything wrong. “But they’re just snails,” he told me. “They can’t feel anything. They’re not human.” And I remember crying that night, crying and thinking to myself that if we’re all snails coming out in the rain, then I hope to god there aren’t any humans around to stomp on us. It’s years later now, and I still feel the same way, and I still get that helpless, pathetic feeling inside when I wonder <em>but what if we’re all just snails?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				And I had that same feeling as I stood there in Manhattan, skyscrapers towering above me with bright neon lights boasting <em>but look how far we’ve come, look how much we’ve achieved as a people.</em> And I brushed it off with the confidence of a prophet who knows his visions are true, and I couldn’t help but think to myself <em>even the Tower of Babel fell in the end.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				“Can’t you see?” I screamed out. People stopped for a moment and looked in my direction, then continued walking and paid me no heed. I fell to my knees and wailed unselfconsciously in between the throngs of people who were busy going about their day. I had had enough. The realization dawned on me that I finally knew what the Russians were speaking of when they used the word <em>toska</em>. I was the man who Munch had painted in <em>The Scream</em>, and I couldn’t take it any longer – I couldn’t let the charade keep going.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are we doing here?” I cried out to no one in particular. “When it all really comes down to it, what are you rushing for? Don’t these advertisements sicken you? Don’t these uniforms and made-up rules disgust you?”
			</p>
			<p>
				A crowd began to form around me, curious passersby stopping to see what all the fuss was about. I began to feel light-headed, and forgotten images from my childhood swam in my mind’s eye. I loosened my tie. I saw a man with a suit walking by, and I spat in his direction, disgusted. I balled my tie up and threw it at his feet.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Don’t you want to do something meaningful with your life? Are we really just destined to exist, creatures of a brief season, and then disappear like fireflies in the winter?” My head hung loosely on the end of my neck, defeated. I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to feel good again.
			</p>
			<p>
				The man in the suit quickened his pace, his shifty eyes looking around nervously. No one met his gaze. An older man with a ruddy face stepped out of the river of people streaming past me. His voice was as scratchy as the five o'clock shadow that lined his cheeks, and he spoke as if he was accustomed to having a cigarette dangling out of his mouth.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are you complaining about? Everything is in order, can’t you see? We have it so good here; we have convenience stores and hot dog vendors, pretty women and an entertainment industry solely concerned with keeping you entertained. This is <em>America</em>, this is the capital of the world!”
			</p>
			<p>
				The older man’s drawl confirmed my suspicion that he lacked any semblance of an education or inherent intelligence, and I shook my head in quiet disgust.
			</p>
			<p>
				“He’s right!” a nearby hot dog vendor exclaimed, pushing his way to the front of the crowd and slapping the older man heartily on the back. “Nothing cheers you up like a hot dog, nothing!” He looked around for support, arms outstretched, palms up. A few people clapped. The hot dog vendor looked strangely surprised, as if he expected more of a standing ovation.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Who can think of hot dogs at a time like this?” I wailed, amazed that the sheep were so happy being fenced in. “We’re all playing a big game of king-of-the-hill,” I said. “We’re all simply fighting to get to the top, pushing others down so we can reach the peak, and for what? What are we going to do once we’re up there, are we going to try and sell the view to the highest bidder?”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Hey!” Someone shouted. It was a young woman, pointing her umbrella at me like a long, indignant finger – an accusing, irritating gesture. “What are you so unhappy about? Everything is in order, everything is as it should be. You wake up in the morning, you go to work. You leave work, you go to bed. What’s so bad about that? Think about how much worse people have it in other countries before you start pissing on your own.”
			</p>
			<p>
				There was sporadic applause. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and hearing.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What did you want to do with your life?” I said to the woman with the umbrella, challenging her.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What did you <em>really</em> want to do? If you had a time machine and could go back to the you when you were seven years old, would your dreams still be in tune? Or would the seven-year-old you laugh in your face about being a lawyer or a banking executive, or any of those other highbrow titles that simply mean <em>this is how I’m wasting my life and I’m proud of that fact, thank you very much.”</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				The crowd fell silent for a moment and I reveled in the glow of a minor victory. A wizened old man pushed his way to the front of the crowd with obvious difficulty, his breath heavy and strained by the time he made it to the front. The crowd watched him approach with wary eyes.
			</p>
			<p>
				“So what would <em>you</em> do if you had the choice?” He asked, waggling a long, wrinkled finger in my direction. “Would you want to be out picking berries all day and wandering the forests like a gosh-darned <em>hippie</em>?” As if to emphasize the last word, he spat a thick glob of brownish phlegm into the street. There was a fire in his eyes that hadn’t been seen since the second world war, and the crowd reacted as one, momentarily looking away, disgusted.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s what I thought,” he said, mistaking the crowd’s reaction as agreement and beaming unselfconsciously. He stood up straighter, his chest puffed out and his chin raised with a defiant, haughty air, and for a brilliant moment he was a soldier once again.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m not saying we should return to the forests,” I began, treading carefully. “I just want the ennui of our daily lives acknowledged. I don’t want to keep living my life walking past the same faces every day without ever meeting their gaze or saying hello, or, god forbid, actually sitting down and speaking with them, seeing what these strangers, these humans who look so much like me are all about.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“We’re talking right now, aren’t we?” The woman from before said, clearly agitated. “And look how well this is going.” She waved a hand at the glum countenances of the assembled crowd. “All smiling faces,” she added sarcastically.
			</p>
			<p>
				I ignored her barbed statement and continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How can you go on living like this?” I screamed, frustrated that no one felt my existential dread.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How can you go on stumbling through life jumping through hoops and ladders, always conforming, always placing yourself in neat little boxes with pretty little labels and never asking questions?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I paused and took a deep breath. “When you thought about your life, did you ever expect it to turn out like this? Did you wake up one day and think to yourself <em>maybe I don’t want to be an astronaut after all, maybe what I really want to be is a marketing executive?</em> We live in a society scared of its own shadow, a society where convention is the only rule and there are no exceptions. Is that what you wanted?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Well, I don’t know about you,” the hot dog vendor said, “but does anyone want a hot dog? They’ll cheer you right up and you’ll be back on track in no time, no time at all!” He looked around again, but no one clapped this time. He turned and walked off down the street, his shoulders hunched, muttering something unintelligible under his breath.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Listen,” the woman from before began, “I’m very proud of my job and my life – very proud. And you know what bothers me the most about this world? It’s that everyone’s so thankless. People like you – complainers, never actually helping benefit society, just criticizing it. Maybe you should go out there and try to change the world instead of just standing on your little soap box here trying to demoralize people and make them question their existence. Maybe you should just go find something to do with your pathetic little life, and stop trying to obstruct those who do know what they’re doing. Maybe then you’ll get the answers you’re looking for.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked at her with the patient, knowing eyes of a mother who’s about to console a distraught child.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Do you know what I think?” I said. “I think you’re going to be in exactly the same position I’m in now, although it might take you a few years to reach it. And I honestly can’t tell you if you’ll reach it by ascending to a higher truth, or if you’ll reach it by plummeting down to the hallowing depths of rock bottom, but I know you’ll be where I am now, and you’ll immediately recognize it for what it is. And when that happens I want you to think of me, to picture my face and my pain, and use the philosophy you used today to try and console yourself. And I want you to see if that works, because you can only lie to yourself for so long before you realize that your very existence is a lie.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“You’re disgusting,” she said. “Vermin. The scummiest of the scum. You’re trying to proselytize good, happy people into your depressing school of thought, and for what? So you could go and ruin everything we humans worked so hard to achieve?” She scoffed and walked away, visibly upset. I wasn’t concerned. I knew it would catch up with her one day.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rest of the crowd were murmuring amongst themselves and soon began to dissipate. I sat down on the cold, dirty sidewalk and cradled my head in my hands. And as the tears started falling, I thought of my friend and his father, and how they bonded over a blatant massacre. And just like my friend before me, I prayed for rain. I prayed for a biblical bout of rain that would wash away our sins along with our civilization. And even the word <em>civilization</em> itself was an oxymoron; there was nothing civil at all about civilization. And as my body heaved and shuddered, I dreamed of a huge wave, unlike anything that had ever come before it, a Goliath of the seas. And as I sat there, I couldn’t help but notice a sound like running water, like the floodgates had broken and all hell was about to break loose.
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked over and saw the biggest wave I had ever seen, a true monster that towered over the buildings as if they were made out of Legos; and as it curled back to peak height all the sound disappeared, sucked into its gaping maw. People around me began to scream, but it was too late as the buildings crumpled and the streets became aqueducts, swallowing people and cars alike with terrible speed as the wave coursed through the city, spitting and churning and sweeping everything up. Terrified people ran past me as the wave slowly made its way closer, some jumping clear over me. I sat there watching the whole thing, awestruck, not knowing if to believe it or not. Was this really happening? As the wave came closer and closer, I couldn’t help but think of the woman from before, I couldn’t help but wonder if she was happy with how her life had turned out, if she’d gone to her watery grave pleased and with no regrets. And as the wave curled back and towered above me, about to come crashing down, I couldn’t help but smile a smile of relief, of thanks. Today the rain washed the snails away instead of bringing them out into the open. And it’s funny how the world works. Maybe there is a god above us, and the same story repeats itself every few millenia. Maybe every building and skyscraper in this cursed city was a Tower of Babel in itself, and had to be destroyed. I smiled contentedly in the face of absolution. <em>Maybe next time we’ll get it right,</em> I thought, happy to finally know how the world worked. <em>Maybe one day we’ll get it right.</em>

      <h2>((the hedonism manifesto))</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.”
				<br>
				-Oscar Wilde
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">“What do you mean,</span> you feel guilty?” He shook his head, disgusted. “You think you’re the first person to ever feel guilt, to ever regret an action you made; to ever wish you could turn back time and take it all back, hit reset and start all over again?” He scoffed. “People spend their whole lives as prisoners of their emotions, perpetually wracked by stress, anxiety and the lesser emotions: guilt, regret and fear..”
			</p>
			<p>
				I stopped him mid-sentence. “But those feelings <em>must</em> serve some purpose; they can’t just be vestigial artifacts leftover from the dawn of man to plague us. Maybe the advent of guilt was a necessary development for human beings to coexist with each other. Maybe guilt was a safeguard for society so that when you screwed up once and hurt someone, you regretted it afterward so even though it initially happened, and you hurt the person, you learned from your mistakes and were less likely to repeat them in the future. Maybe that’s why it’s necessary to take guilt into account, and not just set it aside and ignore it as a <em>lesser emotion</em>, as you so eloquently called it.”
			</p>
			<p>
				“Guilt? What about it? You have to change your worldview to accommodate your lifestyle. There are no second chances in this game, this existential trap. You sit there and beat yourself up over spilled milk – and for what? - when you can just as easily move on with your life. The weak minded person is a slave to his mind, subject to its whims and fancies and always the butt of its jokes. The truly strong man, then, has set guilt aside and developed a new form of conscience, a mindset free of regret; and he second guesses himself not out of doubt, but out of a strict methodology. He subjects himself to analysis: he is, in no uncertain terms, the subject of his own analysis.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He paused for a moment, his eyes lost in the clouds. A fire burned in them, a raging, burning beast that threatened to leap from his eyes and set others ablaze. I’d never seen such unbridled passion before, and I wondered what sparked it; what injustice had been committed however early on in his life to have necessitated his mode of thinking. I could tell he was passionate about this subject and truly believed that he benefited from it, although it was a passion that could very easily manifest itself in a self-destructive form. He continued:
			</p>
			<p>
				“These emotions, guilt and regret, they cloud the mind; they are the pangs of pain you feel when your mind bleeds. For the exact same reason you can determine whether or not a given system is efficient by the waste it produces is the same way you can determine whether or not your mind is efficient. In a perfectly efficient system there is no noise, there is no excess chatter, for noise is energy being lost. It is by this byproduct that you can conclusively determine that there exists a lapse in efficiency. Guilt is a representative of much the same principle. A perfectly efficient mind doesn’t bleed, it recycles that energy and uses guilt as a tool to its advantage, not to its disadvantage. The wise man, then, takes guilt into account but is not bound by it. He tallies it diligently: he studies the pros and cons, weighs the consequences and ramifications of his potential actions, and pores over his notes. He learns. He adapts. Guilt is the byproduct of an inefficient mind. You will have many such conflicts in your life, my dear boy, and this is only the beginning, I assure you. But it is up to you to choose how you will deal with them.”
			</p>
			<p>
				I listened, captivated at the sheer audacity of the words coming out of his mouth. He had a point, yes, but the idea of him actually living that philosophy was not only the mark of the true asshole, but borderline sociopathic. I was almost embarrassed to call him my friend.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Aren’t you worried about how your actions will affect other people? If you go on living like that; if you go on putting yourself on a pedestal and disregarding others, and then not even feeling guilty afterward… it’s almost inhumane. It’s disgusting, really. What you’re asking me to do is fundamentally wrong, and the first thing you should ask yourself any time you try to implement a new moral code, a new way of thinking is <em>what if everybody did this?</em> How would the world look if it wasn’t just one person doing this on an individual level, but everyone, on a mass scale?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed. “Don’t you get it? The only reality that really matters is your own. The only universe that exists, as far as I’m concerned, is my own. Forgive the cliché remark I’m about to make, but we’re all actors in this play, and those other people are <em>strangers</em>. The majority of them don’t care about you, wouldn’t give two shits if you were out there in the pouring rain changing the tire on your car, and wouldn’t even say hello if they walked past you on the street and you were the last two people left on Earth.” He stopped for a moment and took a deep breath, and I could tell he was proactively trying to relax his tone and remove the soapbox edge from his voice.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Now don’t get me wrong, there are good people out there, and that’s a wonderful thing. I think very highly of you, as I’m sure you thought very highly of me before this conversation. I fear you may lose some respect for me after this, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take to help you deal with this guilt issue. It’s both necessary and prudent to treat people with deference and respect so that you don’t go through life being a bitter, depressed old man who is always angry and treats others like trash. I may say all these terrible things, but understand that when I’m out in public I put on a wonderful facade and I’m charming and intellectual and nothing but nice – I may be a bitter, jaded old man on the inside, and I may think that people in their very nature are expedient, but understand that I constantly seek out those few angelic people who are <em>good</em> at heart, and worthy, and I aspire with all of my being, with every last shred of essence, to make them my friends. People like you. People who can take what I say and apply it in their own lives. And remember: I’m not telling you to go out there and be snotty and treat others like trash, what I’m saying is that you are the master of your own mind, and you shouldn’t have to be subservient to its flaws.”
			</p>
			<p>
				We sat in silence for a few minutes, watching the shadows dance on a nearby wall and listening to the digressions of our minds.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But aren’t you scared about the ramifications of thinking like that?” I asked, breaking the silence.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Aren’t you worried that if you think like that, you’re eventually going to slip into a hole that you yourself dug, and slowly and surely distance yourself from others and lose touch with the world?” I stuttered, tripping over my words in the flurry of emotions that had been triggered in my head.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Until we had this conversation, I was convinced you were a good person, and it’s not that I don’t now, but it’s frankly shocking to know that you think like that, and believe it, deep down inside. And I still think you’re a good person, and I’ve personally seen you go out of your way on numerous occasions to help strangers even though you scoff at the idea of Good Samaritans, and pass them off as a rare and prized commodity; mere anomalies in the grand scheme of society. Aren’t you scared about how the world would be if everyone only cared about themselves?”
			</p>
			<p>
				“The world will continue, my dear boy. It will endure, and it will forget about you, if it hasn’t already. What I’m teaching you is the art of adaptation, how to be a chameleon in human skin, how to make the most of your brief sojourn on this terrestrial plane. The prophets and mystics are wrong: <em>the end of the world will never come.</em> The end of <em>you</em>, however, will come. Play your cards well, my boy, for time is running out, and you are the master of your own mind:you manifest your own destiny.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“I wonder how much more of you there is beneath your flawless facade,” I said, stunned. “I’ve known you for years – years! - yet I never knew this aspect of your personality. You really are quite multifaceted. Pray tell, what other surprises do you have in store for me?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed. “After this conversation, you’d be hard pressed to believe that I could ever fall in love.” He laughed again, from the heart.
			</p>
			<p>
				“But I do fall in love. I fall in love over and over, brief forays into fantasy: I’ve loved more girls than you will ever know, or they will ever know. One should always be wary of the tricks his mind plays, of the delicate dance of pheromones and oxytocin, of falling into the abstract delusion that is love. Yet I find myself falling into the same trap nearly every day. I see a woman walk into a cafe; she is beautiful and her very essence screams to me, reaches out and tugs at my heartstrings, and I find myself fantasizing, for a delicious moment, about the potential romance we could have; the delicate brush of her hair against my face, her lips against mine, softer and more full than they have any right to be. Her touch is ecstasy, her movements the very definition of <em>allure</em>.” He paused for a moment, lost in thought.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Yet it doesn’t end there. The mind is a magnificent instrument, yet it is one that is in constant need of calibration. I imagine what would happen after the novel glow of a new romance dissipates. I think of our first fight. Is she rational, or is she liable to fall into hysterics? Do we kiss and make up, dragging the relationship on indefinitely, or do we decide to part ways, leaving us exactly where we started again: back at square one, in the cafe, me admiring the delicate swell of her breasts peeking out from beneath her cashmere sweater. And it’s hard, you know, to fall in love so many times and so easily. It tortures the soul. But even though we never talked, and we never got to know each other, when she smiles at me on her way out of the cafe I can’t help but feel a tremor in my heart. Will she remember me? Will she think of me, that young man in the cafe, and wonder to herself, <em>why didn’t I go over there and talk to him?</em> Will she go home to her boyfriend, and give him a kiss - more out of obligation than desire - and think, even just for a moment, about what it would be like to kiss my lips? Will she wonder, as I have wondered many times before, what it would be like to wake up next to me, to playfully fight over the sheets in the morning, to give me a kiss right on the tip of my nose and whisper <em>I love you</em> in my ear? Or will she walk out of that cafe and think that maybe she’s not as attractive as she had previously suspected, that maybe she’s losing her charm, her youthful sex appeal, and crave love with every cell in her magnificent body?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He laughed again, but it wasn’t as musical as before; it was tinged with a melancholy bitterness that made me look at the floor and away from his eyes. He looked much older for a moment, and I wanted to reach out a hand and pat his shoulder, a show of support. We may come from entirely different families, you and I, but we’re brothers nonetheless.
			</p>
			<p>
				But I didn’t.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Wouldn’t that technically be a weakness? Wouldn’t that be going against your philosophy, letting your mind play tricks on you? All those false starts must take a toll on your emotional well being, or at the very least, wouldn’t they slowly desensitize you to love, real love, not mere fantasies?”
			</p>
			<p>
				He looked pensive for a moment.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Don’t think I haven’t considered that possibility. I’ve spent many a sleepless night pondering its effects and if I should let my mind wander that delicate arena like a lost puppy, always searching, sniffing around, hot on the trail of love and desire.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				“Listen,” I said, nervously changing the subject. “I’m scared of tomorrow, of a new day. When I think about the future, and the looming thought of old age, I get a kind of anxiety that’s hard to describe. Like a weight, a tension so real I can feel it, and it’s more than just tangible, it’s debilitating. Why do we have to be the only animals that fear death? Why can’t we just bumble along through life without worrying about it so much, losing so much time and energy to something so inevitable?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I sighed heavily, frustrated and sad.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Fear? What of it? The things a man fears are almost never the ones he succumbs to, yet they rob him of his time, sapping away at his soul with an unprecedented diligence. It is a maladjusted conscience a man should fear, not life itself. Let life happen. Be more than a simple buoy bouncing in an endless sea. Find yourself, orient yourself, and take on the world. Throw caution to the wind. Get a taste of adventure. Go to foreign and exotic lands, and try foreign and exotic drugs with foreign and exotic people. We’re creatures of habit until the bitter end, and tell me, honestly, would you really want to go through life without any scars? Without those nights where you wondered, with all of your heart, if you would make it to see tomorrow? Embrace danger, embrace anything that holds a chance of killing you. For it is those things, and only those things, that pose any chance of liberating you from this meaningless, senseless ennui. Or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I looked at my watch. I wasn’t satisfied with my life. Not now and maybe not ever, but I did know one thing: I had to go. I had to leave, to throw myself into an entirely new environment and subject myself to new experiences. Time is running out, and we’re always one step behind it, running after it screaming like pedestrians chasing a moving bus: always hot on its tracks and almost there but never going quite fast enough to hop on board. It was time to grab the reins and shape my life, and as I left the cafe I couldn’t help but feel his last sentence resonate, playing over and over in my head like a broken record: <em>or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?</em>

      <h2>((the best part of dying))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">“Hey,”</span> the bum said, to no one in particular. “You’ve got to keep your chin up! Roll with the punches. Then, when they’re not looking… you strike!” He got up and shadowboxed for a few seconds, demonstrating surprising agility for a man of his age. A young boy walked up behind him and tugged on his dirty shirt, startling the boxing vagabond.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What are you doing?”
			</p>
			<p>
				The question was as benign as it was open-ended, and tinged with the unique blend of naivety and innocence that only a child could pose. The bum spun on his heels, fists up, to face the boy. He studied him cautiously for a moment, then let his hands drop to his sides. He sat down next to his stack of newspapers and stared blankly at the street once more.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m watching the patterns,” he said, pausing momentarily in anticipation of an interruption. Finding none, he continued.
			</p>
			<p>
				“People are generally nothing more than automatons, pawns who get in your way.” He grinned, exposing strangely white teeth. They seemed out of place on the older man’s dusty face.
			</p>
			<p>
				“They’re ruled by desires and fears, by the constraints of society, by the limitations of their intellect. They make the same mistakes their parents made, over and over, and then they resign themselves to thinking <em>this is how it is</em>. This is life, and getting older and more habit-dependent is the natural order of things.” He scoffed.
			</p>
			<p>
				“They’ll tell you over and over <em>son, you’re a dreamer</em> but don’t ever get your head out of the clouds. Don’t let them anchor you down to this world, to this mess that they’ve left for your generation to clean up. Hopefully. As if their generation tended to the mess left by the previous one.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy listened intently. <em>This man is speaking to me like he would another adult,</em> he thought. It was refreshing to be treated as an equal. He sat down in the grass next to the old man and retrieved a stick of gum from his pocket, tearing it in half and offering one of the pieces to his new friend. The older man accepted it graciously.
			</p>
			<p>
				“So I come here, day after day, and I watch the patterns. I see the same people walk by, slaves to the same daily desires, creatures of habit until the bitter end. I see the same mother drop her kids off at school and then run to Starbucks to get the same sugary latte, day after day, and whittle away what’s left of her life by playing Farmville on her overpriced iPhone. She’s never had a more successful virtual enterprise in her life, and she couldn’t be happier. With the exception of that nagging little afterthought in the back of her mind, the one that keeps whispering <em>but why didn’t you just start a real business?</em> She’s set, happy and content.” The bum turned to look at the boy.
			</p>
			<p>
				“That’s the same reason you shouldn’t play Guitar Hero, by the way, and just pick up a real guitar instead.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy listened, mesmerized. <em>This old man is interesting,</em> he thought, <em>much more interesting than mom or dad or any of those other people who are always too busy to pay me any attention.</em> He scooted closer to the bum.
			</p>
			<p>
				“What’s your name?” He asked, holding his breath and barely containing his excitement.
			</p>
			<p>
				“You do have a name, don’t you?”
			</p>
			<p>
				The old man sighed, suddenly tired.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“They called me Robert, before I dropped out of society. Robert Goddard. A name I was given by two people who loved me enough to name me and then leave me in an orphanage, abandoned. The product of a midsummer night’s dream.” He laughed, a dark, pitiful noise that seemed to hang in the air. He hugged his knees to his chest, rocking back and forth with his shoulders hunched, eyes fixated on an uneven patch of cement in one of the sidewalk squares. His white teeth were hidden behind an implacable frown.
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy furrowed his brow. He didn’t quite understand. He had a nagging afterthought that it would make sense to him one day, in the most terribly cruel way, and it would hurt him, years from now, in ways he wasn’t yet able to fathom. He decided to put it aside for now.
			</p>
			<p>
 				“So what do they call you now?” The boy was a bit peeved, although he wasn’t quite sure why. The sun didn’t seem as warm and comforting as it had been a moment earlier, and it seemed as if an invisible tension had fallen over him, as if he was being forced to grow up a bit faster than he ordinarily should have. He began to daydream about the abstract concept of <em>influence</em>, without actually having known the word. There was something otherworldly about this old man, he thought, something different and pure, a power in his words.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I guess my name is still Robert,” he mused, “but no one has called me that in years and years.”
			</p>
			<p>
 				A leaf that had been rustling in the breeze detached itself from a nearby tree and began its melancholy descent towards the ground. Autumn was almost over, and the days were getting shorter and colder. They watched in silence as the leaf got caught in a thermal and rose melodramatically, higher and higher, until it gently see-sawed its way to the ground. The old man’s eyes brimmed with tears, and for a long time neither of them spoke, each one lost in his own psychedelic thoughts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The boy thought about growing up, of the elaborate mystery of life and age and of the countless levels of experience one gains with each passing day. <em>I was so young this morning,</em> he thought. <em>I still have so much left to learn.</em> His head throbbed at the prospect of living to be his mother’s age. How would he remember it all? Where would it fit? He felt like he was suffocating, like the weight of the world was on his shoulders and was slowly pushing all of the air out of his lungs. <em>Anxiety</em>. Another concept he didn’t understand but he would have to get accustomed to.
			</p>
			<p>
 				The image of the leaf drifting to the ground played on repeat across the old man’s tired eyes. <em>Nothing lasts,</em> he thought. <em>Everything just gets older and replaced and forgotten.</em> He thought about his life, of the years of cold hard experience and the subsequent years spent analyzing them; of the euphoria and unbridled passions of youth, that effervescent pipe dream, that splendid, stupid naivety. He thought about his forthcoming death and its inevitability; of that beautiful, silent reverie. The thought was dark and alluring like a temptress reeling him in, and he didn’t resist, succumbing to her charms and wondering <em>what would it be like to feel nothing?</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				***
			</p>
			<p>
 				The old man was surprised to find himself in a beautiful garden surrounded by apple trees. The humid air was thick with pollen and the roses were blooming, giving off a sweet, almost intoxicating aroma. He was sitting cross-legged on a venetian rug with a dizzyingly intricate pattern and sitting across from him was by far the oldest woman he had ever seen. He could barely see her eyes beneath her hooded cloak, and the face that peered out at him was ancient, creased and ravaged by the merciless hands of time. Her lips were dirty and chapped, and she had an odor to her, like the musky smell of potatoes that have been left in a rucksack for too long. It reminded him of something, of a fertile woods-goddess or the mother he never met, of home, wherever it was, always so very, very far away.
			</p>
			<p>
				He looked around, bewildered. The old woman studied him apathetically, and he squirmed like a child in the dentist’s chair for the very first time: nervous and scared but knowing, deep down inside, that somehow he was going to leave in far better shape than he had come. It felt like she was delving into his mind, opening old cabinets here and peeking under the corners of carpets there, shuffling through stacks of paper and half-read books, leaving nothing behind in her wake. He came to the conclusion that he didn’t mind. It was a confession of sorts, and the easiest kind since he didn’t even have to confess to anything, just the crime of having lived a long time and having made many a mistake along the way. He felt relieved, and for reasons he couldn’t explain he trusted the woman more than he had ever trusted anyone. It felt good, that trust, to open up to someone after being alone for so long.
			</p>
			<p>
 				Maybe one spoke or the other imagined it, playing off it and countering the imagined statement of the other, parlance-style, parrying and lounging, deftly interpreting and analyzing imagined allegations. Again and again they took turns talking, or imagining it, and after a veritable lifetime adrift on the sea of their collective thoughts they felt that they had understood each other perfectly. Such was the gift of life and the malleability of thought, and the beautiful sophistication of those mysterious invisible lines that wend to and fro, connecting us to one another. For there was intrigue in the lives of others, and a dark, voyeuristic allure in that which is not ours. The old man closed his eyes, content. <em>So this is what dying feels like,</em> he thought. <em>I like it.</em>
			</p>	
			<p>
				***
			</p>
			<p>
 				He opened his eyes and found the boy staring at him, jaw-dropped and a look of utter disbelief on his face. “Robert! Robert!” he shouted, his high-pitched little voice brimming over with fanciful excitement. “You should have seen it! The woman, the mother, the patterns you were talking about and her iPhone! She dropped it. I saw the whole thing while you were spacing out, or thinking, or whatever it was you were doing.”
			</p>	
			<p>
				He was positively ecstatic and barely maintaining composure. The old man just nodded and listened with a dull, detached look in his eyes, still entranced from his foray into death. “She dropped it right as she was walking out of Starbucks and the screen cracked. You should have seen it! She screamed and threw her latte at the wall, and everyone acted like they didn’t see it.” He thought for a minute, his little face scrunched up, deep in thought. The bum looked across the street in the direction of the Starbucks. There was a telltale brown splotch on the wall. <em>That’s going to stain,</em> he thought. He still had his familiar cynicism but it had lost its edge. “I still don’t get it though,” the boy said. “How come everyone acted like they didn’t see it? I know they saw it. I saw them see it.” He was frustrated and in dire need of consolation, but the old man didn’t quite know how to explain it to him. He sighed again, and for once, language failed him. He extended an arm. The boy scooted closer and leaned his head against the old man’s chest. Life was strange and getting stranger every day, but he was glad. He had learned a lot today, and made a new friend. He was ready for the adventure of life and the promise of tomorrow. He couldn’t wait to grow up. <em>Today was a good day,</em> he thought.

      <h2>((the trouble with dreams))</h2>
			<p>
				To my dearly departed lover:
			</p>
			<p>
				How I wish you were here to tell me again about the dream that changed you so.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ll never forget how you woke me up that next morning and before you had even said a word I could immediately tell that something in your nature had changed, some undeniable truth in the core of your being had shifted, metamorphosed - so powerfully and completely that it was as undeniable as it was irreversible.
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn’t quite realize it then, but I know it now – with that heart-wrenching, utter certainty that goes hand-in-hand with hard truths – that you woke up as a different person. Your eyes had the look of one who had tasted the ambrosia of the gods, had conferred with the serpent and eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge – and lived to tell the tale. It wasn’t you, my dear, who woke me up that morning – it was someone else entirely, a prophet from the land of dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				You spoke with a passion so unbridled and reverent that I dared not question the validity of your claims, dared not ask how much it hurt to end up back here, <em>home</em> (that velvet-lined prison cell), deposed from the kingdom of Heaven and thrown back into this rat’s maze of cruel reality. Oh, how much it must have worn you out to have tasted bliss and been thrown back here in seeming exile, how frustrating it must have been.
			</p>
			<p>
				You told me that you found yourself in a world similar to ours, but at the same time so very different: about a heavenly city where people went to sleep without worries and woke up without the need of alarms; of humans that weren’t scared of what they were or who they would become because they were already entirely themselves: beautiful, and infinite, too; an unwavering force like the one that moves the sun and moon in their fixed orbits, creatures of divine habit. You said they burned brilliantly, each one radiating a thousand beams of light, and to stare at them was to know God (but only because you could recognize yourself in their being, for we are all gods, every last one of us).
			</p>
			<p>
				The way you described first finding yourself there – was that nothing short of Revelation? - how you woke up in Xanadu and everything was as it should be: soft white sheets, a benevolent sun warmly shining down upon you, and music of the most divine order playing on instruments that had yet to be invented (or so you swore). You said that upon waking you realized two things at once - disparate, contradictory things, but undeniable truths nonetheless – that you had never been so sure that you had finally found home; and that you had the unmistakeable feeling of finding yourself in a dream, but knowing, deep down inside, that it was more than just a dream: it was the one true Reality all the mystics spoke of, the eternal godhead.
			</p>
			<p>
				And perhaps what resonates most strongly in my mind was how you described the people of that city: they looked the same as the people who inhabit our world, you said, but dressed in a different garb – a sort of flowing, soft robes that brought to mind the Phoenicians of ancient days, or perhaps the Greeks - but all in earth tones, no blacks or blues or reds or whites, but rather forest greens like the trees that line the streets of Adrogue, or the burnt umber of Native American pottery and the rich ochre color long used to symbolize holiness in the East. And the faces – oh, how you regaled me with stories of their faces! - you said that the people of the city had the most angelic expressions, what human faces were meant to look like: faces unblemished by the cruel contours of hate and malevolence, faces that were a testament to the purity of the soul. You likened your attempts at describing that subtle manifestation of inner peace to the thousands of philosophers who have tried to explain the Buddha’s smile over the years – it was something you had to see for yourself to believe, you said; it was something you had to experience. And even before that fateful dream you told me of whole books you had read about the Buddha’s appearance that described how anyone who came into contact with him could immediately tell that he was enlightened, from his passive smile to the gentle way he held his hand at his side so you knew without a doubt that he was pure. You said that you had found a world populated by saints, and the beautiful smile painted across your face told me that you didn’t lie.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you never told me much more than that – you told me about how much you felt at home, how you knew without a shadow of a doubt that your stay there was limited, and how you cried because unlike other dreams you knew this one to be True – and you completely immersed yourself in it; whether knowingly or unknowingly, it makes no difference. But you never told me how it ended – simply that you realized that our world (or should I say my world, since you are no longer a part of it) was just one big freeze-frame of suspended animation, one big iridescent raindrop tethered to a clouded sky; a world run by demons at the expense of the good: one big, perpetual mistake.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s been three years now since you’ve killed yourself, and I can’t stop wondering if it was to reach that same divine dream-scape you had visited that night in March. Perhaps it’s selfish of me to ask, and perhaps it’s wrong of me to suppose, but I never thought to ask you if there was a place for me in your perfect world, and I never before thought it to be an appropriate query. But my heart has grown sick with longing, and I’ve grown to understand that a house without the sound of your laughter can never be a home, and I can’t help but wonder if I’ll meet you up there in your city in the sky.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it pains me to say this, but those three years have been the hardest of my life. I spent every day convincing myself that you reached your promised land, that you smiled just as radiantly as when you first found yourself there, and that all the pieces fell into place perfectly and without a hitch while I suffered in the hell of your past.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe this is my curse, but I’ll never forget how you said that you kept waiting for the clouds to part and for that ominous raindrop to finally fall from the sky and drop to earth; how you kept waiting for the sun you knew was there to peek out from behind those ugly gray clouds and brighten your world again. But it never came, and I’ll never hold you responsible for not being able to persevere; I’ll never blame you for your actions. And maybe the worst part about all this is that I thought I had finally found you that morning, but it had never occurred to me until now that that was precisely the moment that I lost you forever.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wish you all the best, my love, nothing but the best.

    <section id="hallucination">
      <h2>((a hallucination trapped in amber))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">There is a vision</span> I had years ago that fills me with such longing and despair that it dampens my brightest of moods, a revelation granted to me by the gods that to this day both burdens and enlightens me; a celestial summons that forces me to ruminate upon my own temporal existence. Understanding it, I fear, remains a Sisyphean feat.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>There was no context:</em> it was as if I had suddenly been deposited into an intimate meadow in the remote forests of Siberia. I remember how the mist, strangely sentient, slowly spread apart as I approached, exposing the cobblestone path that weaved its way through the tall grass and dense foliage towards the bleak gray sky and foothills of distant mountains. A passing breeze brought rows of glittering raindrops like an emerald wave, and then - as if perfectly commonplace - they froze, suspended in the cold air; each one a divine multifaceted mirror, each facade a microscopic disciple of reality.
			</p>
			<p>
				I stood there entranced, a little boy facing the adversities of the world, a prisoner in my ethereal hell. It seemed time had stopped underneath that unforgiving sky, and all that was left was the pits.
			</p>
			<p>
				There was a clamor of cymbals as the hypnotic fog began a dance, one that started as sweetly and elegantly as a rose but gathered speed and intensity as it tore through the raindrops, galvanizing them into motion. They paired off, waltzing and spinning between the ornate balustrades of a royal wedding reception; the marriage of my only daughter, and it was here, you see, that I find myself today; a much older man now than I was then, and singing an altogether very different tune. I know now that youth is wasted on the young just as wisdom is wasted on the old, and I am no better a man for it, just older and jaded and more tired.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes I can’t help but think that perhaps it wasn’t a vision I had all those years ago, but one that I am having: for time blew past in such a shudder while I stared, lost in those magnificent evanescent raindrops, that it seems as though I lost my youth to the cruel Sirens of time. It is youth’s felicity as well as its insecurity to think that such trapdoors of time are too cruel a card to play; and it is age, not reason, that shows me that my life is a house of cards that is being blown away in the wind, one by one, like leaves being shed from a tree, little minutes being sheared off by the indiscriminate clippers of time.
			</p>
			<p>
				And just like that – <em>poof!</em> – it’s gone.

				<span class="open-quote">This is my apology</span> to the denizens of the slums en masse:
			</p>
			<p>
				After all these years of despair, I am writing this to let people know the truth of what happened, and to let people know that I truly regret the role I played and the consequences of my actions. I’m not proud of what I did, but I feel closure is necessary. They say that repentance paves the road to salvation, and if so then at least I know that I’m on the right track.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a young man, I was kidnapped and forced to take part in a series of remarkably violent crimes, crimes that haunt me to this day and ravage my dreams. I came to know the names of my captors during the brief stints of sobriety in which my drug-addled brain attempted to recuperate. Jules was the quintessential alpha male; muscular and with a shaved head, he was the kind of irascible person that you always wanted to keep an eye on. His lower back and part of his left rib cage had been tattooed with strange runes that were static, but appeared to be moving as soon as I shifted my gaze from them. Sahme was the wild card, nicer to me than Jules was at first, but he had a violent streak about him that I couldn’t help but dislike. Skinny and fast, he was built to climb fences and run from the local militias that had been plaguing his existence in these slums for years. His lower back was tattooed as well, although it was just a snaking trail of dots with a crooked feather at the end – it looked vaguely familiar, although I couldn’t tell you from where.
			</p>
			<p>
				We met under bizarre circumstances that I can’t quite recall due to smoking something they always carried close at hand, a malignant substance they called ‘the white pipe’ – a potent, highly addictive mixture of dagga and Mandrax, a banned tranquilizer. The white pipe originated in Africa and was a devil’s drug that gave you an intense, aggressive high for a few hours and made you liable to commit acts of extreme violence while under its mischievous spell. It was cheap and base, and very unpredictable. When coming down off of the white pipe, it dropped you off somewhere in the suburbs of euphoria to recuperate and try not to think about the spontaneous acts of violence you had undoubtedly manifested. My exposure to it was forced, although I can tell you that smoking it got easier and easier every time.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was while I was under the influence of this powerful drug that I learned a few things about humans - the capacity for violence is not merely a human phenomenon; it has its innumerable roots set in the animal kingdom and deep within our psyche. Every once in a while, the weeds from these roots latch onto a neuron, firing what we call primal urges and impulses. It is this predetermined faculty of violence, matched with our superior intellect and cunning that makes the human such a dangerous creature.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luckily, we do have an innate defense mechanism for dealing with such horrors; thereby allowing society, and subsequently civilization, to flourish. Criminal rage is a tide with ebbs and flows that can be prevented by the systematic utilization of postpartum psychological dams to steady the mind’s murderous waters into a more manageable stream – whereas white pipe is the sudden rush of water that slams into those same psychological dams, setting free wave after wave of unrestrained violence and aggression. It is this, paired with white pipe’s potential for addiction that makes it purely diabolical in nature and, by definition, anathema to society.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was while I was addicted to this awful substance that I lost sight of the life I used to have: living in the slums with my girlfriend and trying to forge a better living for the both of us, undoubtedly in vain. Mine was a pathetic existence, tumbling down the streets as a dirty vagabond, but it was off-kilter enough that I could actually enjoy it and call it my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the few occasions that I tried to break free from the clutches of the white pipe, fragments of dreams would come back to haunt me; piecemeal images of the happier life I used to have. They were the brief spurs of nostalgia that I could not act upon, no matter how hard I tried.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">

			</p>
			<p>
				I distinctly remember the day my nightmarish new life began. We had been driving down the snaking back alleys of downtown – Jules at the wheel, Sahme sitting shotgun, and me on the bench in the back. It was broad daylight out so I wasn’t expecting anything bad to happen – everyone in this sprawling city was accustomed to the usual terrors only occurring after dark; daytime was considered a sabbatical cease-fire of sorts where the inhabitants of this god-forsaken city were free to go about their day without fear of violence.
			</p>
			<p>
				This all changed when Jules stopped the car next to a grocer’s shack and approached a woman sitting in her car, a beat up old Toyota from decades past. Without warning us, or even saying a word, he approached her car and opened fire point-blank into the driver’s side window with a gun I didn’t even know he had, turning what used to be her head into a crimson mess of bone fragments and glass. I was horrified, pounding on the inside of Jules’ truck, beating on the windows and pushing Sahme in front of me to let me get out, to <em>please just let me out of the fucking car.</em> I wanted no part in this egregious blight; I didn’t know anything of the sort was even going to happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jules opened what now appeared to be the ex-woman’s door, and politely stepped aside as her slumped body fell out onto the ground, seemingly in slow motion. He calmly proceeded to take the purse sitting on the passenger seat, and do a quick once-over of the car to determine if there was anything worthwhile left to steal. Finding nothing, he turned his back to the wanton mess he had left and began walking at a brisk pace towards the truck, a sardonic grin pasted across his face.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, it was clear that Sahme wasn’t going to let me get out of the car, and so when he passed the white pipe to me to calm me down, I had no choice but to sit back and accept it with a resigned sigh. It turns out I was still their prisoner after all. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, their rivulets leaving clean trails on my grimy face. The scene I had just witnessed felt like it could have easily been from another universe – this was reality and people’s heads were simply not meant to turn into abhorrent messes like that. Jules got into the car and peeled out, the smell of burnt rubber coalescing with the bitter chemical odor of the white pipe made me sick to my stomach and I vomited out of the window – Sahme just looked back and laughed.
			</p>
			<p>
				That night, Jules and Sahme made it very clear to me that I was going to help them and that we were going to be working together as a crew. I was already an accomplice they said (they were absolutely right, of course) so what did I have to lose? The cold look in their eyes screamed <em>no is not an answer</em>, but it was the only one I could think of and I defiantly challenged them. It took hours, but eventually they beat me into submission and made me understand that my place was at their side. The white pipe was incredibly conducive to violence, and they were prepping me with it to use me as a tool to their advantage – to <em>our</em> advantage, now - to help them commit these horrible crimes and become the plague of the streets that I myself had once tried to eradicate. I was being primed to become my own worst enemy. Had I been a stronger man, I would have died before giving in, but alas, I was not, and am not, and these words are history now.
			</p>
			<p>
 				It was only a few weeks later that the realization dawned on me that this was going to become my new life – committing brazen robberies by day, and shrinking back into the shadows of the slums at night. After the first few robberies, we had begun to reverse the existing system of safety by day, danger at night. We became the callous outlaws who had made it dangerous <em>always</em>, we were the scum of the earth that had taken a collapsed society one step further into a dark abyss that it couldn’t ever hope to back out of, we were the fear behind every lonely pedestrian’s eyes, we became the collective terror that roamed the streets. And <em>fed</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We worked hard as a team, and we watched each other’s backs – within a few months we had become professionals and the range of our attacks extended as far as our whims, driving haphazardly to places we’d never been to before to terrorize a new suburb, to expose a new town to our savage ways.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">
				-3-
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything had been going swimmingly for close to a year now, and we had quite a stash at our disposal. We jokingly likened ourselves to modern-day pirates guiding our weathered truck through concrete seas, weaving our way across cracked black asphalt to ubiquitous enemies we chose seemingly at random. In the beginning we didn’t discriminate when we robbed; a victim was a victim and we did what was necessary to stay afloat as our loot piled up higher and higher in the truck bed, but as of late we had set our sights on more fruitful victims: the few remaining upper-class leftover from the fall of modern civilization. They were easy to spot; they had a swagger about them that they couldn’t hope to hide in a million years, but the swine seldom left their barricaded homes for fear of, well, people like us.
			</p>
			<p>
				We had taken to pawning the goods immediately after a heist, driving a few cities away before word got out that there had been another attack. We almost had enough cash to drive into the sunset and make a name for ourselves in some other town, just drive for days or even weeks until we reached one that we felt comfortable in and eventually settle down and never openly speak about how we got there. It was the proverbial mortar that bonded our trio’s figurative bricks, the common dream we all shared and aspired to achieve.
			</p>
			<p>
 				Our strategies grew more and more complex, leaving small margins for error. We each did our part, strapped to the teeth, and wreaked havoc upon our quarry with pitiless assaults and stoic faces that made us appear almost godlike in our victim’s eyes - we were violence personified. We were the divine angels that granted mercy in its purest form: <em>death</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paranoia grew with the months, and dissent crept in with its own agenda. The drives to virgin cities went from being raucous and merry to quiet, brooding trips rife with arguments over the potential local militias that might await us. Had we grown too bold? We had been pulling the same basic maneuver for almost a year now, and we were terrified that our once-captive audience was finally catching onto our game. Cities held no formal communications with one another, and so they weren’t theoretically alerted to our ruse beforehand, but rumors spread like fire, and that was a threat to our very existence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Unbeknownst to us at the time, we were in an irreparable state of <em>folie à trois</em> – the three of us caught in a vicious cycle of influencing each other’s already-paranoid delusions about the cattle turning the tables on us, the day they waited to ambush us in <em>the perfect trap</em> - and thereby we impressed our own psychotic worst fears upon the group as a whole, each of us adding our own little twist to the ‘last day’ scenario in which we would be looking down the proverbial gun barrel ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consequently, we perpetuated our fallacy of imminent doom as opposed to the converse reality that we actually lived in – there was a definite risk of an armed rebuttal, but the chance of it occurring was no greater than the one we had originally started off with. There was always the possibility for such an ambush, but with the scope of our attacks it just wasn’t feasible that an ambush would ever be waiting for us. We had gotten our cake, and we intended to eat it, too.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">

			</p>
			<p>
 				I remember the last time I saw Jules and Sahme. We had been in one of the only nice cities I’d ever laid eyes on, the kind of place I’d want to grow old and die in. There was something almost ethereal about the way the light fell onto the plants and trees that surrounded the buildings, how certain cobblestones seemed to light up and shine in a strange dance as we made our way up the road towards a store on a hilltop. The sublime melodies of songbirds filled the air, and I deeply regretted the fact that we would be breaking the serenity of such a beautiful place.
			</p>
			<p>
				We got out of the truck around the corner from the storefront; Jules was methodically checking his gun, and Sahme was tying his shoelaces. I admired the view from our elevated position; there was a field with neat rows of fruit trees planted as far as the eye could see, and they stood majestically in the afternoon sun. It was the first and last time I had ever seen an orchard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahme called me over, breaking my spell. I switched the safety off of my gun and took a deep breath: it was time. Normally one of us would stay in the car as a getaway driver, but we all agreed that that wouldn’t be necessary here - the orchard was on the outskirts of the city, and no one was around for miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The door at the storefront was open, and we sauntered through it with the casual air of professionals, the guns in our hands the only hint to our malevolent intentions. There was a boy sitting on a chair near the door, and he stared at us with wide eyes as we walked by.
			</p>
			<p>
				The shopkeeper looked up, a beautiful young woman of about nineteen or twenty, and dropped the pen she had been writing with out of sheer surprise. She reminded me of the girlfriend I had left behind, and I was almost immediately overcome with emotion. I raised my hand in the hopes of aborting the operation, but Sahme slapped it down with one hand and pulled the trigger with his other.
			</p>
			<p>
 				To her defense, the poor girl didn’t even make a sound; she just stared at the red stain that began at the front of her apron and raced down to her knees, a crimson mess that complimented her rosy cheeks. Exhaling loudly, she slumped to the ground and lay still.
			</p>
			<p>
				The echo of the gunshot rang out across the fields and galvanized us to attention. With barely a moment’s hesitation, the three of us began scouring the store for valuables and the safe – we would find a way to break it open later. Somehow I managed to suppress my anger, constantly reminding myself that I would let Sahme have a piece of my mind as soon as we had gotten safely away from this once-perfect city. Our treasure trove secured, we left.
			</p>
			<p>
				With one final glance back at the store, we ran to the truck and piled into our usual positions – Jules driving and Sahme sitting shotgun, me on the bench in the back. Jules was laughing as he started the car, a sadistic laugh that turned into wet choking noises as the staccato of bullets came in through the rear window and passed through his head, leaving a glistening red curtain across the inside of the windshield.
			</p>
			<p>
				I turned back just in time to see the boy from the store drop the gun we didn’t expect him to have; and for some reason I thought back to the first robbery, when Jules had killed that poor woman with a gun that I didn’t know he had, either.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sahme had already thrown the passenger door open and jumped out of the car, running berserk towards the boy on the hill with his gun blazing. Without thinking, I threw myself out of the car and shot Sahme in the back, three gratifying pulls of the trigger that made him scream as he dropped to his knees and lay prostrated in the grass.
			</p>
			<p>
 				I looked at the boy, and for a moment our eyes met - an ineffable exchange passing through those once-innocent eyes to my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				My heart was beating a tattoo in my chest as I turned around and walked to the other side of the car, pulling Jules’ limp body out of the driver’s seat and letting it fall into a heap on the ground. I accidentally stepped onto his face as I pulled myself into the driver’s seat, and it collapsed with a sickening yet strangely satisfying <em>crunch</em>. I turned back onto the cobblestone road and headed back in the direction of the only home I knew, the slums I came from.
			</p>
			<p class="markers">

			</p>

				Many years have passed since I last saw that boy on the hill, and time has taken its toll on me. Breaking my addiction to the white pipe had made me regress into an animal state, easily panicked and frightened by my own shadow for months until the withdrawals finally ceased and I felt human again – human enough to be wracked with guilt and wake up screaming in the night, clutching sweat-soaked sheets and praying to a god that didn’t listen. Jules and Sahme still make cameo appearances in my dreams, but I’ve learned to shut them out, to resist their evil influences and attempt to get on with my life.

				I finally found my girlfriend again, the girl I was destined to marry, but she left me – calling me a brute, an animal, a proponent of sadism. I tried to convince her that my will was manipulated, that I was being used as a tool but she never did believe me. I’ve lived alone ever since, destined to waste away in solitude in honor of my victims, and it irks me to know that after all these years, there’s only one thing I’m really sure of: hell isn’t a place you go to after you die, hell is the life you live after you’ve squandered your own.

      <h2>((the manifesto of the marquis de sheric))</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="open-quote">About five years</span> ago, I left the twin suitcases of my sanity behind as I dove, headfirst, into the rabbit hole. I began to get inklings of something divine, caught glimpses and hints of a pattern of enormous consequence – a pattern so subtle that, to quote Calvino, it could escape the termite’s gnawing. At first I was overwhelmed with possibility: drunk on the prospect of catching onto the Bigger Picture, madly inspired by a dream not yet fully articulated but realized enough to have credence. It was what historians would refer to as a ‘frozen moment’ – a turning point, a decisive, defining moment in the course of my life. Since that day I have focused and refocused my sights on a very particular, very ambitious goal. It has spurred me to go to the other side of the world, and not just once. It has led me back in time, through books and drugs and the words of dead men, to pick up where they left off and serve a higher purpose, a shared vision. William Blake and Antoine de Lavosier had a similar experience. Both had mystical, life-altering experiences that would forever jar them out of ordinary consciousness. They articulated part of a law, part of a set of governing principles that I believe turns the gears of the world. They understood the first law of thermodynamics before it was recognized as a law, before our understanding of it changed our world. They caught onto one of the pillars of The Way The World Works, and by no simple act of happenstance. Both were elect, servants of a higher purpose.

				But verbalizing this is akin to doing nothing, nothing more than giving myself a nice, firm pat on the back. This is philosophical masturbation. But it is important to state since I have devoted my entire life to this endeavor, towards a better understanding of the things I feel actually matter, more than our silly jobs and rules and TV sets, more than the suits we wear and our noses held so high. The police officer with his badge. The judge with his gavel. The mother with her furrowed brow and the concerned look in her eyes. And I feel myself beginning to fall, tumbling and flailing down the rabbit hole, at an ever faster pace. I feel the gap between myself and others widening, yet paradoxically coming closer in bursts of clear, white light that illuminate the whole world for brief instants at a time. I find myself possessed by radical notions, things so clearly obvious and capital-t True that they are unshakeable and have come to define me. Borges, Calvino, and E.M. Cioran have had a similar experience. Laplace, Camus, and Feynman have had a similar experience. It would be cliché to mention Einstein, yet he too has had a similar experience. Hesse, Nietzsche, and Wilde have had similar experiences. Jung, of course, had this experience – and Jung, in my humble opinion, was one of the only men who ever actually woke up – a truly remarkable feat when one understands what an encumbrance Western society is to this sort of thing – to shun the customs of the world and everything that people, at large, hold so dear. The fools truly do love their chains.

				In my opinion, understanding the way the world works doesn’t only have to work in retrospect. I think that once you understand the way a system works, you can change it, and the world is no exception – I know that for a fact. And I’m not saying that I know the way the world works entirely – only that I’ve made huge strides in understanding, in getting closer to the bigger picture, and that I can prove it fundamentally. The foundations of my beliefs are so out of tune with the way people normally think that I’ve come to realize that verbalizing them is an act of war: people don’t want to be roused out of convention. No one wants to hear that they’re living a lie, and yes, this is pretentiousness at its finest. There’s an old saying that states that your answers are only as good as the assumptions underlying your questions, and I really believe in that. And I think that people aren’t ambitious enough in their thinking. I think that people don’t understand that they can and do change the world. I think people let their subconscious dictate their life, and then blame it on fate or god or a host of other stupid cop-outs instead of standing up and taking responsibility. I think that habit and convention are two of the biggest vestigial defects in humans, and that the majority of us are sleepwalking through our lives. I think time doesn’t quite exist as we think it does and mind-reading is, in fact, possible. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous and silly that people are scared of death for the simple reason that they falsely defined it. I believe in a duality of things, in blacks and whites with infinite shades of gray in between, and I think that the world is a big Rorschach inkblot: that everything, every object, every piece of art, every human being, every patch of blue sky, is a mirror held up to ourselves. I believe in the entropy of all things. I have unshakeable faith in several laws, and not man-made laws, but laws that existed before human beings came into the picture to sully a perfect world. The Golden Ratio, the Constructal Law, the laws of physics and quantum mechanics. Jungian psychology. The theory of the adjacent possible. I think that life and death are a series of rooms. I think that we take life too seriously and that there’s a lot to be said for throwing caution to the wind. I’m trapped in a paradox: I don’t think I’ll ever die, yet I’ve died before. I think that syntax is everything, and that I’m a meta-physician. I think that cancer is a form of life, but working in the opposite direction. I think that the universe is a hologram, and that twins are the living, breathing example of quantum entanglement. I’ve had startling epiphanies that I’m a figment of someone’s imagination, the very form and shape of their dream, and that when their alarm goes off in the morning and they have to go to work I’ll be really, really fucked because – poof! - I’ll be gone.
			</p>
			<p>
				But maybe I won’t quite disappear, maybe I’ll leave my words behind for some ambitious young man to find, thousands of years from now or the turn of a page from now, and maybe then I won’t hit the bottom of the rabbit hole but rather fall directly into that person’s mind, like a fully-formed philosophy with ramifications of a startling nature, and then maybe I’ll live like a saint in his mind, like some of the gods of my philosophies that I named above. Beautiful and irrefutable. And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.

          About the Marquis
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Marquis de Sheric is an alias used by the Oakland-based writer Yuval Allweil.
          He is a young man who travels extensively and has reportedly been spotted riding atop a camel at breakneck speed through the ancient city of Petra, trekking through the Himalayas armed with Voltaire, and sleeping spread-eagle on the floor of the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris in what one could only assume was an absinthe-induced “surprise nap” (and rightfully so).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Marquis enjoys all manner of obscure esoterica and practicing dialectics, and once challenged the entire world to a duel (the world politely declined). He was once confronted by an aggressive monkey in a temple in central India, and has since referred to the monkey in question as “the only truly worthy adversary I know.” As a consequence of this chance encounter, he cites Rajasthan as the place where the Hindu deity Hanuman will be resurrected, thereby confusing two entirely different religions in a bungle of such epic, unprecedented proportions that it is quite possible that he will be lynched by believers of both those religions, working together for the first time, ever, against a common enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that does happen, his seat in the annals of history is guaranteed.
