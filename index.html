        <span class="open-quote">“Fear? What of it?</span> The things a man fears are almost never the ones he succumbs to, yet they rob him of his time, sapping away at his soul with an unprecedented diligence. It is a maladjusted conscience a man should fear, not life itself. Let life happen. Be more than a simple buoy bouncing in an endless sea. Find yourself, orient yourself, and take on the world. Throw caution to the wind. Get a taste of adventure. Go to foreign and exotic lands, and try foreign and exotic drugs with foreign and exotic people. We’re creatures of habit until the bitter end, and tell me, honestly, would you really want to go through life without any scars? Without those nights where you wondered, with all of your heart, if you would make it to see tomorrow? Embrace danger, embrace anything that holds a chance of killing you. For it is those things, and only those things, that pose any chance of liberating you from this meaningless, senseless ennui. Or are you perfectly satisfied with your life just the way it is?<span class="end-quote">”</span>

        <blockquote>
          “It looks like I’m back at square one again, musing about life with as much hope as a suicidal cynic with a finger on the trigger. There’s quite a schism between reality and fallacy, but which looking glass do we choose to look through most often? Upon scrutinizing, you’ll find a twisted survival mechanism innate to all of us – a hope delusion – and we’re all victims to its perpetuity schemes. Self preservation sounds great on paper, but if we’re all living in the misery of the present, with our wars and hate and oppression, why persist?”<br>
          –Taky–dyzamof
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <span class="first">It’s six o'clock</span> and I’m already late for my first meeting with the psychiatrist. I’m walking through a corridor lined with sterile white walls, where the air is stale and the few passersby I see don’t smile. Neutral colors and over–medicated shells of humans are the only company I have in this depressing environment, and I wonder why they didn’t at least try to make a mental health center look more optimistic. The permanent residents of the facility gaze at me with vacant eyes, and I’m glad that I came here of my own accord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I arrive at Room 103 and find a nondescript door with a simple plaque stating DR. GROSCH. Scuff marks line the bottom and it appears to be slightly ajar. I begin to 	knock and the force of it pushes the door open; it glides forward slowly and quietly on greased hinges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I step inside and find the psychiatrist waiting, but <em>psychiatrist</em> doesn’t quite seem like the right word. He’s impish and slight, with what looks to be a perpetual sneer – not necessarily a bad characteristic, but it looks like he’s privy to something that the rest of the world doesn’t know – and it amuses him to no end.
        </p>
        <p>
          His three–piece suit has that forlorn look to it, as if it only truly lived when it was considered hip, and is depressed and world–weary to have fallen out of style. He leans forward with his hand outstretched, and I shake his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Are you familiar with Rorschach inkblots?” the psychiatrist asks.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no introduction, nothing more than a handshake and a very direct question. I briefly wonder if this is a technique commonly employed by psychiatrists to catch their patients off guard, or if he’s simply trying to make up for lost time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yes. I’m meant to tell you what I see – what I think I see, at least – in these inkblots, and then you take notes and act like you can make sense of these things.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The psychiatrist pauses, momentarily caught off guard. The smile at the corner of his mouth grows until it expands into a laugh, the kind of laugh that sends chills down your spine. I wasn’t exactly thrilled about having a psychiatrist who put me on edge, but figured that I just had to get used to him first. Foreign people tend to be eccentric anyway, and I couldn’t quite pin down where he was from.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’ll give you several of these inkblots,” he began. “You study them, take as long as you want, and tell me what you see. What images fill your mind’s eye, what memories are triggered, that sort of thing. What we’re looking for here is <em>significance</em>.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He slides one of the inkblots from his pile across the table at me and I pick it up. It looks like a cross between a picture of a cat and a Jackson Pollock painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It looks like a cat,” I stammer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Just a cat?” He asks, “tell me, how does that make you feel?”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the typical psychiatrist response I should have expected, but I felt comfortable with him. It was as if we weren’t having a therapy session at all and were instead having a one–on–one improv session, a contest of sorts to see which of us held the upper hand. If this was to be a test of guile, I intended to win.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, it makes me feel good. Powerful. Life is all about playing cat–and–mouse and overcoming obstacles, attaining goals, that sort of thing. Cats are stealthy, lithe creatures. Intelligent. I feel like I can relate a lot to a cat.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Do you own a cat?” He leans back in his chair, folding his arms across his lap. His sneer is gone; his gaze intent, focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t. I’ve never really considered myself responsible enough to own a pet. I wasn’t raised with animals in my home so I don’t really see it as a gap I have to fill, you know.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The psychiatrist nods, seemingly satisfied, and selects another inkblot from his stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          “How about this one?”
        </p>
        <p>
          He hands me the inkblot and I study it carefully for a few minutes, my brow furrowed in concentration and telltale beads of sweat forming at my hairline.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Is this a joke?” I didn’t like what I was seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What is it?” he inquires, “what do you see?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “It looks like a coyote. Normally that wouldn’t be so bad, but it throws off the pleasant euphoria that I’d been enjoying from the previous inkblot – in a world of cat–and–mouse, I felt powerful being the cat, and related to it quite well. This coyote, it compromises the cat since it’s higher up on the food chain. A predator <em>to</em> a predator, so to speak.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying the inkblot again, I lean forward, incredulous. The inkblot looks like it’s swirling, taking on a different hue, changing. The coyote is still there, but it looks like it’s devouring something, tearing it to pieces. The cat! This doesn’t bode well with me at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look up, eyes wide open, and find the psychiatrist closer to me than I had expected him to be, a wry, almost wolfish grin on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You look surprised,” he states matter–of–factly. “What is it that you see?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “My cat. Me. I’m being eaten by what I can only see as a bigger threat to my existence, one I can’t hope to escape from. When the odds are stacked hopelessly against you, optimism is akin to futility.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Does that bother you? Does it hurt you to know that there will inevitably be obstacles in your life too big to overcome? Are you prone to <em>failure</em>?”
        </p>
        <p>
          The way he spit out that last sentence, how he emphasized the word failure, struck me as odd. It was like he was trying to instigate something, trying to badger me into snapping and saying something I didn’t necessarily mean to release. I decide to ignore the bait and continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It’s disconcerting, that’s for sure. It pains me to understand that as a human, as a person, I’m extremely well cut–out and adapted to just about anything that might come across my path, with the exception of some things – creatures, afflictions, cruel twists of fate. Disease, war, you name it. It doesn’t seem <em>purposeful</em> that I exist only to be struck down, however eventual that may be. I like to think that I’m here for a reason, that somewhere down the line I’m instrumental to some grander scheme that I alone am not fully capable of understanding.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The psychiatrist looks at me, thoughtful. “Go on.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The tone of his voice underscores his true sentiment: <em>that’s a nice fallacy you’ve been developing there. Now justify it.</em> 
        </p>
        <p>
          “All I’m saying is that life isn’t fair. No one said it had to be, but the fact remains, and I still see it as a hit below the belt. If hope is a necessary function for survival, then why were we given the intellect to question it as well?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen, I don’t mean to segue but I think it’s time for another inkblot to be brought into the equation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I hesitate, momentarily unhappy that he doesn’t have an optimistic retort.
        </p>
        <p>
          The psychiatrist hands me another inkblot, lightly brushing my hand with his fingers as he lets go of the card.
        </p>
        <p>
          This one is more chaotic than the previous two had been. The inkblot is comprised of many little figures; it looks like the islands that make up an archipelago or, upon closer scrutiny, a swarm of bees.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This one looks like a swarm of bees. It’s reassuring, almost, since I can apply what I know about bees to myself and the predicament I’m in. Each of these bees has a purpose, a responsibility and obligation to the community that is always for the greater good. There’s another aspect to it as well – bees function using a hive–mind. This means that each worker bee, no matter how obscure or low in the pecking order, has a distinct purpose and serves as a benefit to the hive as a whole. The queen telepathically sends out messages to the subservient worker bees – attack, collect food, pollinate, etc – and each bee is instrumental to the community as a whole, even if on an individual level they don’t understand the bigger picture.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Kind of like you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Precisely. What I need now is proof that I am instrumental to that greater good, and not just as a corporate shill. Holistically speaking, the bee hive makes perfect sense, but on an individual level one must still wonder – are those little worker bees frustrated with their seemingly banal, mundane existence? If they, like me, can’t even begin to comprehend the bigger picture, what makes them persevere? Is it their lack of an ability to second–guess? Trivial a question as it may be, if bees possessed an imagination, and subsequently a lust for power, would <em>coup d’etats</em> be rampant in beehives?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Grosch exhales loudly and leans back into his chair, folding his hands over his chest in a determined manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So what you’re looking for is closure, someone to tell you that everything is alright and that you’re doing a great job – waking up in the morning like a good little worker bee and going straight to the office, diligently slaving away your life for a nominal income and then tucking yourself into bed at night; depressed and alone, a pawn in a chess game that is beyond your individual comprehension. You won’t be getting any such reprieves from me.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I was completely taken aback by his insolence, one step below seething rage, but was somehow able to hold my composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So what makes you all–mighty? Tell me, doctor, because I’m dying to know. I don’t believe in a puppet–master god who holds all the strings, an absolute authority that I can’t even hope to reckon with. I like to think that I’m in charge of my own life, and call it what you will – blind ambition, human arrogance, or even human nature – I like to think that I’m in control. I enjoy the thought, fallacy or not, that I’m the one in charge – not of others, but only myself. And I don’t want to be anybody’s pawn.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Your frustration has been noted. I’ll let the big man upstairs know, but for now, it’s time for another card.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring his sarcasm, I pick up the next inkblot and strain my eyes to make sense of the image in front of me. My first impression is that it’s of a broken world, a post–modern dystopia in which civilization has lost what little actual civility it once had. I can’t shake the feeling that it looks like a remarkably accurate representation of the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I see the husks of broken buildings jutting into the air, with impromptu dirt roads traversing the rubble and debris that line this city’s streets – streets that could have once been glorious avenues or boulevards, a bleak picture of a bitter future. Skeletons of empty highways show that a civilization once prospered here, but has been lost to time. What was once a metropolis has been reduced to a de facto society, and look – you can even see squatters milling about the town square, hoping to find a bit of food, a bit of nourishment to carry them from one sullen day to the next. I see a post–apocalyptic city, where warmth is a rare and prized commodity and suffering is an ever–present companion to the denizens of this accursed place. This is as close to a hell as I’ve seen, and for what? Because boys will be boys, and wars are just the natural progression of our childhood fights with neighbors and friends?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I see a glimmer in Dr. Grosch’s eyes, and I wonder if it has always been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So tell me, doctor, what I <em>really</em> have to look forward to. On a long enough timeline, we’ll blow each other out of the water and it’s Cain and Abel all over again, brother against brother, and then what? This? No thanks. I can’t be part of a society that is so resolute in its own destruction. If this is the future, then count me out, I don’t want to persevere in a world that’s so blatantly headed in the direction of its own downfall.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The psychiatrist looks at me apathetically and pulls open one of his desk drawers, studying the contents with an almost strained silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You said that you wanted to be in charge of your own destiny, that you didn’t want a puppet–master god pulling the strings for you. Now it’s your turn to deal with the problems of ambition. You, and only you, can bring down the Tower of Babel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He reaches into the drawer and pulls out a handgun, wordlessly sliding it across the table to me, and in the same fluid motion lifts himself out of his chair and walks past me out of his office. The door swings shut with a gentle click behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be that he’s bluffing, or it might just be another test that I’m going to fail anyway, but Grieg’s <em>In the Hall of the Mountain King</em> starts playing in my head and becomes more and more tumultuous with each passing second. Everything speeds up as the insights I’ve attained throughout my life coalesce into one beautiful, glorious epiphany and I slide the barrel of the gun into my mouth, taking a deep breath of reckless abandon and knowing full well that the oxygen harbored in my lungs will go as stale as my heartbeat. I pull the trigger, and silence comes crashing down as I leave my own mark upon this world, a beautiful red Rorschach inkblot sprayed across the white wall behind my head.

          About the Marquis
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Marquis de Sheric is an alias used by the Oakland-based writer Yuval Allweil.
          He is a young man who travels extensively and has reportedly been spotted riding atop a camel at breakneck speed through the ancient city of Petra, trekking through the Himalayas armed with Voltaire, and sleeping spread-eagle on the floor of the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris in what one could only assume was an absinthe-induced “surprise nap” (and rightfully so).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Marquis enjoys all manner of obscure esoterica and practicing dialectics, and once challenged the entire world to a duel (the world politely declined). He was once confronted by an aggressive monkey in a temple in central India, and has since referred to the monkey in question as “the only truly worthy adversary I know.” As a consequence of this chance encounter, he cites Rajasthan as the place where the Hindu deity Hanuman will be resurrected, thereby confusing two entirely different religions in a bungle of such epic, unprecedented proportions that it is quite possible that he will be lynched by believers of both those religions, working together for the first time, ever, against a common enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that does happen, his seat in the annals of history is guaranteed.
