				About the Marquis
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Marquis de Sheric is an alias used by the Oakland-based writer Yuval Allweil.
				He is a young man who travels extensively and has reportedly been spotted riding atop a camel at breakneck speed through the ancient city of Petra, trekking through the Himalayas armed with Voltaire, and sleeping spread-eagle on the floor of the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris in what one could only assume was an absinthe-induced “surprise nap” (and rightfully so).
			</p>
			<p>
				The Marquis enjoys all manner of obscure esoterica and practicing dialectics, and once challenged the entire world to a duel (the world politely declined). He was once confronted by an aggressive monkey in a temple in central India, and has since referred to the monkey in question as “the only truly worthy adversary I know.” As a consequence of this chance encounter, he cites Rajasthan as the place where the Hindu deity Hanuman will be resurrected, thereby confusing two entirely different religions in a bungle of such epic, unprecedented proportions that it is quite possible that he will be lynched by believers of both those religions, working together for the first time, ever, against a common enemy.
			</p>
			<p>
				If that does happen, his seat in the annals of history is guaranteed.
